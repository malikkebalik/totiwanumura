Miles went on to front the band Ra Ra Riot. Koenig has stated that growing up, he was musically inspired by the Ramones, Run DMC, and Blondie, among other artists that his dad often listened to. His music tastes evolved into liking more hip hop artists like De La Soul and Tribe Called Quest. He also has stated that he is a fan of the Grateful Dead and Sublime.</p><p>After high school, Koenig attended Columbia University. While a student there, he ran a blog called "Internet Vibes" about fashion, existentialism, personal identity and modern culture.

Later that year, they put some of their demos online. Music websites like Stereogum and Pitchfork raved over the demos.

In 2010, they released their second album "Contra." That album was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album at the Grammy Awards. They released their third album in 2013 called "Modern Vampires of the City." It was nominated in the same category at the 2014 Grammy Awards and this time, Vampire Weekend won the award. In 2019, they released the album "Father of the Bride." That album won the band a second Best Alternative Music Album Grammy Award at the 2020 Grammy Awards and was nominated in the Album of the Year category.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-289167 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ek.jpg alt width=762 height=554 sizes="(max-width: 762px) 100vw, 762px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-289167 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><p>In addition to his work with Vampire Weekend, Koenig also began hosting his own internet radio show on Apple Music in 2015 called "Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."

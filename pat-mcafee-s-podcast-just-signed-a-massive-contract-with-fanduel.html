Not a bad haul by any means, though certainly on the lower end of NFL salaries.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Since retiring in 2016 (when he was only 29 years old), McAfee has turned his attention toward broadcasting. He's had stints at Barstool Sports, Fox Sports, ESPN, DAZN, Westwood One, and SiriusXM, and created his own Pat McAfee, Inc. (PMI) brand.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-326862 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-1135449631.jpg alt width=900 height=623 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-326862 class=wp-caption-text>Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images for SiriusXM</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>One of those PMI shows, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Pat McAfee Show</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, just scored a deal that greatly surpasses all of McAfee's career NFL earnings—and then some. The podcast and FanDuel agreed to a four-year deal worth roughly <strong>$30 million per year</strong>, according to </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span style=font-weight:400>The Athletic's Shams Charania</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>That means that for every year over the next four years, McAfee will make double what he made during his entire eight-year NFL career.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The agreement, which is dependent on FanDuel remaining the official sportsbook of the show, also includes an opt-out clause after three years.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>McAfee started </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Pat McAfee Show </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>in February 2017. The first episode featured <a href=# title="Glenn Robinson Net Worth">Glenn Robinson</a> III, <a href=# title="Matt Hasselbeck Net Worth">Matt Hasselbeck</a>, and Dan Dakich. McAfee called it a "very, very, very, very, very small" show but helped it grow over the years. And now, with more than 550 episodes under its belt, McAfee is cashing out in a big way.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, he has no intention of stopping the show or resting on his laurels. The money will be used for even bigger and better things, and it's a testament to the power of podcasting. It likely won't be the last time an athlete scores a major podcast deal, either.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Check out McAfee's announcement of the deal below.</span></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjqmYrWWdmK6nscSsZKmnlJiutMCMo6ysrF2otqi6xJ1kmmWdlsC0tdWeZJynnqm%2Foq%2FTZq6irJhis6K6w66cpWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./max-topplin-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html><span>←</span><span>Max Topplin Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</span></a>

The show’s eighth and final season looks to play on our nostalgia, therefore it makes sense to do so in this regard as well.</p><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=647 data-injectable=true>Offering one of our best looks yet is that of Stephen Amell himself, who posted the photo found below on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>. Though it may be candid, seeing it in broad daylight allows for us to really take in all the details. Furthermore, there’s some side by side comparison, as the following caption pointed out:</p><p>“Season 8 suit on the left.<br>Season 1 suit on the right.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/arrow-season-8.jpg><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>What’s also worth noting about this image is that Amell is wearing the hood up this time around. In the aforementioned photo shoot with Entertainment Weekly, he wore the hood down for each picture. Here, we can see the hood is as wide and floppy as it’d been for seasons 1-3, yet it has those black flourishes native to seasons 4-7.</p><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>Suffice it to say, I’m looking forward to seeing Stephen kicking ass while wearing his new suit during the final 10 episodes to air. In fact, I’m already contemplating laying down some money when replicas are made available for purchase online.</p><p data-characters=67 data-current-count=67 data-injectable=false><strong>Arrow</strong> returns with new episodes on Tuesday, October 15th on The CW.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y0wMSpn56mXZa6prjLZqqhmaKawG6z0Z6cp2WRp7%2Bww9Jmqp6Zo6S7boSMnKasrKWisnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nsfw-clip-for-scouts-guide-to-the-zombie-apocalypse-is-gleefully-violent.html><span>←</span><span>NSFW Clip For Scouts Guide To The Zombie Apocalypse Is Gleefully Violent</span></a>

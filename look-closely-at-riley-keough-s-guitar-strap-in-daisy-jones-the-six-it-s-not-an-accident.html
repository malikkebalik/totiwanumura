Keough told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Collider</a> that the most important thing about portraying the fictional Daisy was knowing her origins.</p><p>“I think what was most important to me was figuring out where she starts and where she ends, her arc, who she is, and what kind of girl she is when we first meet her, versus at the end when she becomes this different version of Daisy. And I was most nervous about the music because we didn’t sing, Sam [Claflin] and I, before this, at all. That made me nervous. But by the end of rehearsals, I felt really proud of us. I feel like we really put the work in, we were able to play live, and we sounded good. I felt happy about that.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=63 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>Daisy Jones & The Six&nbsp;is streaming now on Prime Video.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ytu86kZJykn6iyrcWMmqtmqpmhsrp5yp6mrp%2BYqHqowcitmKtlo6m%2ForyMoqVmnJGewLp5yailnqtdqbWmedKir2ahpKh6r7vTZpinZZGYsKqwxKeraA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joseph-gibson-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Joseph Gibson | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>

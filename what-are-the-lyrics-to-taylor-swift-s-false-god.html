Think of shows like&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>The Summer I Turned Pretty</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Grey’s Anatomy</strong></a>, or&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Killing Eve</strong></a>&nbsp;— Swift’s lyrical impact on some of our favorite television shows is like the pumpkin spice sprinkle atop the perfect fall (iced) coffee. A Swiftie shared a clip of one of her most memorable television performances in which she belted out the lyrics of a tune that doesn’t get enough credit, as far as we’re concerned. It has people asking questions about what the lyrics are.</p><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>Swift’s “False God,” tells one of her most heartbreaking stories of all, one we’ve all been familiar with despite our best wishes not to be; one of love that gets it wrong, heartache, and the soul-shattering realization that sometimes our best laced romantic intentions belong to a person who won’t ever give us what we need in return.</p><p data-characters=170 data-current-count=535 data-injectable=true>So, what are the lyrics to a song that will stand the test of time as one of Swift’s most angsty, emotional, and beloved songs of all time? Let’s take a look.</p><h2 id=h-what-are-the-lyrics-to-swift-s-false-god data-injectable=false>What are the lyrics to Swift’s “False God”?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>we don't talk enough about the snl false god performance it was literal perfection <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/k48tezt9Ov</a></p>— miguel I taylivia stan (@cowboyinwoods13) <a href=#>October 6, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=555 data-injectable=true>As we said above, “False God” is one of Swift’s most underrated songs, but just because the masses haven’t caught on to its brilliance doesn’t mean that Swifties themselves haven’t adored it since Lover debuted in 2019.</p><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true>The song has always been one we’ve adored, but it was given new meaning when Jenny Han and Co. used it in an episode of season one of The Summer I Turned Pretty, specifically during a scene when Belly Conklin and Conrad Fisher were finally about to share their first kiss. At that moment, we remembered how it felt to be cut so deeply by someone you loved and how brilliantly Swift put it into words.</p><p>“We were crazy to think<br>Crazy to think that this could work<br>Remember how I said I’d die for you?<br>We were stupid to jump<br>In the ocean separating us<br>Remember how I’d fly to you?<br>And I can’t talk to you when you’re like this<br>Staring out the window like I’m not your favorite town<br>I’m New York City<br>I still do it for you, babe<br>They all warned us about times like this<br>They say the road gets hard and you get lost when you’re led by blind faith<br>Blind faith<br>But we might just get away with it<br>Religion’s in your lips<br>Even if it’s a false god<br>We’d still worship<br>We might just get away with it<br>The altar is my hips<br>Even if it’s a false god<br>We’d still worship this love<br>We’d still worship this love<br>We’d still worship this love”</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>Of course, fans know that the song doesn’t end there, but we must examine where we’re right now. Swift sings about religion in his lips, an altar in her hips, and the way worshiping the love they make is worth it, even if it’s only a false God.</p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=709 data-injectable=true>Have you ever fallen for the person your mom warned you about? Have you ever developed feelings for the person your friends were convinced would break your heart, only to realize they were right, but the love was still there anyway? It’s like playing with fire and expecting not to feel the burn. Something makes you want to be the one person who doesn’t end up being scorched, all while knowing it will hurt like hell when it happens.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>“False God” and The Summer I Turned Pretty</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://www.tiktok.com/@chris_briney/video/7225705566138617134?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7187242194124670510</figure><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=710 data-injectable=true>We’ll pick up with the rest of the song as we describe one of the most perfectly timed moments in television history, from the passion in the eyes of Chris Briney and Lola Tung as Conrad and Belly to the way you can almost feel what exists between them to the way Swift’s voice builds as the moment goes completely wrong. If this scene didn’t stop you in your tracks, we just want to ask how.</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=235 data-injectable=false>Conrad has always been Heaven for Belly, but hell is the pain she feels as they fight, and the rest of Swift’s lyrics spell out a tumultuous relationship — the kind that dares you to play a game you know you’ll never win.</p><p>“I know heaven’s a thing<br>I go there when you touch me<br>Honey, hell is when I fight with you<br>But we can patch it up good<br>Make confessions and we’re begging for forgiveness<br>Got the wine for you<br>And you can’t talk to me when I’m like this<br>Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you<br>You’re the West Village<br>You still do it for me, babe<br>They all warned us about times like this<br>They say the road gets hard and you get lost when you’re led by blind faith<br>Blind faith<br>But we might just get away with it<br>Religion’s in your lips<br>Even if it’s a false god<br>We’d still worship<br>We might just get away with it<br>The altar is my hips<br>Even if it’s a false god<br>We’d still worship this love<br>We’d still worship this love<br>We’d still worship this love, ah<br>Still worship this love<br>Even if it’s a false god<br>Even if it’s a false god<br>Still worship this love”</p><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false>Swift’s “False God” performance on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Saturday Night Live</strong></a>&nbsp;started the conversation and was just as impactful as its moment in&nbsp;TSITP. She swayed across the stage with a fire in her eyes that dared a lover to try to cross her again, all while inviting them back for just one last embrace. It’s fire and ice, love and hurt; it’s Taylor Swift at her best.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZpirnV2ptaZ5y7KpopujYsGwedOasKWnomLAuLXFrapmnpGhwKZ5xqibaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-young-and-the-restless-spoilers-danny-chooses-no-one-phyllis-christine-feud-has-rockstar.html><span>←</span><span>The Young and the Restless Spoilers: Danny Chooses No One Phyllis &amp;amp; Christine Feud Has Rockstar</span></a>

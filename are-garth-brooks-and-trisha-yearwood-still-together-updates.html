You can’t walk away,” the dad of three said in an August 2020 press release. “And so, this is probably, you know, the blessing and the curse, this has probably been the most we’ve ever gone through as a couple. But what’s on the other side is so dang worth the wait, especially when you’re with the right one.”</span></p><h2><b>Are Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood Still Together?</b></h2><p><span>Since taking time during the COVID-19 pandemic to focus on their marriage, the pair are better than ever.

That’s the key, plus we laugh all the time.”</span></p><p>In December 2023, the happy couple celebrated their 18th wedding anniversary by sending each other bouquets of flowers.</p><p>“When your husband sends you flowers and you send him flowers and the card says exactly the same thing! #happy18 #love #morethanever,” Trisha captioned an Instagram post.</p><p>Just weeks before the milestone, Garth broke down in tears talking about his loving wife and his daughters.</p><p>“When it comes to the future, I think what you’re just grateful for is just one more day, right? Of getting to do this,” the country icon said during an interview on The Kelly Clarkson Show in November 2023. “So, I think that’s it. What I’d love to say is, the day I take my last breath on this planet, I’d love for my three girls to be around me and I’d love for the queen to be around me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46aqZ5ll5a%2FtbSMm6mop5uoerW%2ByKyfmmWpmq6zw86om2arpJ65rXnTqJ6erJiav3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./3-actresses-who-would-be-the-perfect-fit.html><span>←</span><span>3 Actresses Who Would Be the Perfect Fit</span></a>

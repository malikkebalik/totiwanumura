After graduating in 2004, he took up acting again and landed the role of Devon on The Young and the Restless that same year.</p><p id=par-8_30>Not only is he a sitcom and soap opera actor, but James is also a very talented voice artist who’s lent his vocals to different animated cartoons over the years.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>He’s won many awards for his portrayal of Devon Hamilton</h2><p id=par-9_24>In June 2004, James made his first on-screen appearance as Devon Hamilton on the original <a href=#>CBS</a><a href=#> daytime</a> soap opera, <a href=#>The Young and the Restless</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3 readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il4xKFMlulg</p></figure><p id=par-10_25>The character was introduced as a homeless teenager who is taken in and later adopted by the <a href=#>Winters</a>, the core African-American family within the series.</p><p id=par-11_41>Since the beginning, Devon’s storyline has held the interest of many fans as the show has to focus on the challenges he’s faced of having a drug addict for a parent, being a product of the foster care system, and deafness.</p><p id=par-12_28>Though his storyline has always been complex, James really took this character to the next level in 2006-2007 when Devon contracted meningitis, and the disease nearly killed him.</p><p id=par-13_51>After that, James has brought his all to the character, who’s experienced some of the most emotional and challenging journeys of his life. So far, Devon’s lost his hearing, experienced the loss of a child, married a woman who was on her deathbed, and has suffered the loss of his wife.</p><p id=par-14_61>James has received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Devon throughout the years and has been nominated for the Daytime Emmy in the Outstanding Younger Actor category five times from 2006 to 2009, and once again in 2013.

But now, the actor's home is on the market, listed at just under $8 million, about $800,000 more than he paid for it back in 2006.</p><p>The Los Angeles Times reports that Sheen first tried to sell the house in early 2018, listing it at that time for $10 million. The $7.99 million price point reportedly represents the fifth price cut on the property overall since Sheen has been trying to get rid of it.</p><p>The Mediterranean style mansion was built back in 1992, and includes touches like a two-story dining room, a stone fireplace, and an aquarium. There are also a few more melodramatic elements, like a sliding bookshelf revealing a secret passage to a secret home theater, complete with wet bar and Juliet balcony. Altogether, the property takes up about half an acre, and its lamp-lit backyard has space for not just one but two swimming pools, a spa, a garden, a pavilion and outdoor kitchen, plus, in what might just be a nod to Sheen's involvement in the&nbsp;Major League&nbsp;franchise, a pitcher's mound.</p><p>There's also a private elevator from the kitchen to the master suite, a second more easily accessible home theater, and a gymnasium. And the Mediterranean style design is reportedly a Sheen favorite, since he also reportedly sold off another home in that style in the same Mulholland Estates gated community back in 2015 – that time, he sold for $6.6 million and took a loss of about $400,000.</p><p>You can take a look at the hopefully soon to be former Casa Sheen in the video below, courtesy of Interior Pixels:</p><p></p><p>Hopefully for Sheen, he won't have to cut the price on this home any more in order to sell it, since it's already plunged dangerously close to the $7.2 million he originally paid for it in 2006.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm60zqacrGeTna6zuMieZKyglZq7tHnSoZyrpZGjerCtyqxkppmeqLawuoyiqmaakZi4bsHPZp2oql2orq2xjJqrZnBdoratuMiopWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carnage-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Carnage Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>

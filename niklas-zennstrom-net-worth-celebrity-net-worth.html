Niklas Zennstrom earned his net worth through his investments in Skype, Kazaa, and over thirty other companies. Niklas's biggest win was Skype. He sold Skype to eBay in 2005 for $3.1 billion. In 2011 Microsoft acquired Skype from eBay for $8.5 billion. Niklas actually made another $1 billion off that sale.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Niklas Zennstrom was born on February 16, 1966, in J√§rf√§lla, Sweden.

He embarked on his professional career in 1991 by joining Europe's first competitive phone company, Tele2.</p><h2 id=kazaa><strong>Kazaa</strong></h2><p>And only one year later, Niklas Zennstrom teamed up with <a href=#>Janus Friis</a>, and together, they set up Kazaa, a peer-to-peer file sharing application. Under Niklas's term as CEO, the program became the world's most downloaded Internet software in 2003.</p><h2 id=skype><strong>Skype</strong></h2><p>Zennstrom and Friis then co-founded Skype in 2002 with the goal to free consumers and business associates from the need to pay for talking to each other across the globe. It didn't take much time for Skype to turn into the chief leader in Internet voice communications worldwide, attracting more than 276 million registered users within less than four years of its launch. Skype crowned its success in September of 2005 when eBay Inc. purchased the company for $3.1 billion. Zennstrom served as Skype's CEO from its initiation until September of 2007. Then, the partners changed the way people experience television when they co-founded Joost, an internet TV service and online video distribution service.</p><p>In 2009, Zennstrom re-joined the Skype board when his investment consortium bought Skype Technologies from eBay. In May of 2011, Microsoft purchased Skype for $8.5 billion. It's been reported that Zennstrom and Friis both made $1 billion each between the sale.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-221294 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Niklas-Zennstrom.jpg alt="Niklas Zennstrom Net Worth" width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-221294 class=wp-caption-text>Brian Ach/Getty Images</p><h2 id=atomico><strong>Atomico</strong></h2><p>Zennstrom runs London-based Atomico, a firm that invests in fast growing tech companies with the potential to transform their respective industries.

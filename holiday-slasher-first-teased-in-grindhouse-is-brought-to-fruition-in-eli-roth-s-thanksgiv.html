Since then, two other directors have made full-length films based on their faux trailers, including&nbsp;Machete&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hobo with a Shotgun.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thankgiving-movie-poster-1.jpg><h2 id=h-talk-of-a-full-length-movie-started-right-away data-injectable=false>Talk of a full-length movie started right away</h2><p data-characters=388 data-current-count=388 data-injectable=false>Almost immediately after the Grindhouse double feature hit theaters, fans wanted more from Roth and insisted he make a full-length&nbsp;Thanksgiving&nbsp;film. A 2007&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired</a>&nbsp;article reported that Roth took to MySpace (yes, that’s how long ago this was) to address fans. While he didn’t promise a full movie, he offered hope while promoting merch for the fake trailer.</p><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=708 data-injectable=true>“The first step towards turning a fake trailer into a real movie is to convince the unsuspecting public that it actually exists, and what better way to do that than with a&nbsp;Thanksgiving&nbsp;t-shirt and poster of the Dan Frisch turkey?? … And who knows?

Horror fans are psyched to see that several iconic scenes from the faux trailer made it into the movie, and I’m not just talking about the Thanksgiving Day Parade. An especially horrific kill scene in the fake trailer features a cheerleader on a trampoline, which is briefly replicated in the movie trailer.</p><p data-characters=202 data-current-count=202 data-injectable=false>If you don’t know what I’m talking about, you can see Roth’s 2007&nbsp;Thanksgiving&nbsp;trailer&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;<strong>(Warning: The faux trailer contains nudity and sex acts that are NSFW!)</strong></p><h2 id=h-eli-roth-began-writing-thanksgiving-in-2010 data-injectable=false>Eli Roth began writing ‘Thanksgiving’ in 2010</h2><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=496 data-injectable=true>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Collider</a>, Roth began transforming his fake trailer into a full-length film back in 2010. He enlisted the help of his childhood friend, Jeff Rendel, who also played the Pilgrim in the 2007 trailer. Fans asked Roth about the status of the script during an AMA on Reddit in 2016.</p><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>He told fans the script was still in the works, but it still needed more editing to live up to the trailer. Despite the years of rumors flying around about the movie’s status, fans held on to hope that the film would eventually happen. Our patience proved worthwhile, though, as Roth finally confirmed that&nbsp;Thanksgiving&nbsp;was happening earlier this year.</p><h2 id=h-when-is-thanksgiving-being-released data-injectable=false>When is ‘Thanksgiving’ being released?</h2><p data-characters=134 data-current-count=502 data-injectable=true>Thanksgiving&nbsp;will hit theaters on Nov. 17!

That's where that comes from," Steel said.</p><p>Steel also said that "pushing P," the title of a song featuring Young Thug, was short for "pushing positivity." Prosecutors had accused Young Thug of flashing a gang sign in a photo he posted online, but Steel said he had actually been shaping his fingers to form a "P".</p><p>"It means, any circumstance you're in, if you think positively about something, you can make it through. You're pushing positivity," said Steel.</p><p>"Pushin P" is a trending slang phrase that often honors someone for being a "pimp" or "playa," but is loosely defined.</p><p>In his main argument, Steel said prosecutors had misrepresented evidence and that it didn't make sense for Young Thug to be running a street gang while he was already a successful rapper.</p><p>"He's not sitting there telling people to kill people. He doesn't need their money," Steel said.</p><p>Prosecutors have <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>accused Young Thug </a>and 27 other individuals associated with him of racketeering, murder, assault, theft, drug possession, and boasting about their alleged exploits in rap lyrics.</p><p>They alleged that Young Thug has been at the center of the Young Slime Life gang, and that gang members sought his permission to kill another rapper.</p><p>Steel has said Young Thug was wrongly charged on all counts.</p><p>The case involves Georgia's RICO act, or Racketeer Influence and Corruption Organizations Act. Willis <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>prosecuted former President Donald Trump</a> and his associates under the same act.</p><p>A RICO conviction can lead to a prison sentence of up to 20 years.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/shared/light-switch.png alt="A picture of a switch and lightbulb" itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Sign up for notifications from Insider!

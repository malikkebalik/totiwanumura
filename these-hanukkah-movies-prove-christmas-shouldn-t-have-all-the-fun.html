Never forget that <i>It's A Wonderful Life </i>season overlaps with the Festival Of Lights. And since festive films are the best part of any holiday (next to themed desserts), I've culled together this list of <a href=# class=T3D>eight movies that celebrate Hanukkah</a>. Obviously, there should be way more <a href=# class=T3D>movies about the Jewish holiday</a>, but this selection ought to tide you over until next year. Why watch <i>Miracle On 34th Street </i>for the thousandth time when Santa Claus doesn't come to your house? Why go on <i>National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation </i>when your family has never had a Christmas tree, with or without a wild squirrel living inside it?</p><p>It's true that you've got to dig a little deeper to find those elusive Hanukkah movies. ABC Family has no "25 Days Of Hanukkah" programming block to turn to. But that little bit of effort makes it all the sweeter when you hit on a movie that finally speaks to <i>your </i>traditions and childhood; no chance of taking it for granted, like the Christmas kids. From animated comedy to homage to romances, these eight Hannukah movies are the culturally specific pieces of entertainment you've been waiting for.</p><h3>1. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>An American Tail</i></a></h3><p></p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Click Here To Watch</b></a></p><p>Meet floppy-eared immigrant Fievel Mousekewitz. He and his family come to America from Russia for a new life in <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>this 1986 animated musical</a>. In the very first scene of the movie, Fievel gets a hat from his father as a Hanukkah gift. It's a heartwarming if a little depressing "tail," but you'll be singing "There Are No Cats In America" for weeks after.</p><h3>2.<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> <i>Eight Crazy Nights</i></a></h3><p></p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Click Here To Watch</b></a></p><p>The live recording of Adam Sandler's "The Chanukah Song" became a massive radio hit in 1996. It also provided the title of <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>this animated feature</a>, which stars Sandler as a town ne'er-do-well who gets his act together one December.</p><h3>3. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Little Fockers</i></a></h3><p></p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Click Here To Watch</b></a></p><p>In the third installment of the cringe comedy trilogy, the Brynes family and <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>the Focker family</a> come together for a blended holiday celebration. There have been smoother Chrismukkahs, no doubt, but it just wouldn't be a <i>Meet The Parents </i>sequel if nothing went wrong.</p><h3>4. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>The Hebrew Hammer</i></a></h3><p></p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Click Here To Watch</b></a></p><p>Made for just over a million dollars, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>The Hebrew Hammer</i> </a>pays tribute to Blaxploitation films by casting Adam Goldberg as a private Jewish detective down to seduce women and save Hanukkah.</p><h3>5. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Fiddler On The Roof</i></a></h3><p></p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Click Here To Watch</b></a></p><p>The film adaptation of the classic Broadway musical doesn't deal directly with the celebration of Hanukkah. But <i>Fiddler </i>is one of the most famous and most entertaining films about a particular Jewish experience. Anyway, it's "tradition!"</p><h3>6. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Hitched For The Holidays</i></a></h3><p></p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Click Here To Watch</b></a></p><p>Where there's a holiday, there's a Hallmark Channel movie about it. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>This rom-com</a> is devoted to equal parts Christmas and Hanukkah. It stars Joey Lawrence and Emily Hampshire as singletons of different faiths who fake a relationship to get their nosy families off their backs. I'm just spitballing here, but I'm guessing they fall in love.</p><h3>7.<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> <i>The Holiday</i></a></h3><p></p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Click Here To Watch</b></a></p><p>Yes, your <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Holiday</i> </a>leading ladies swap homes and lives for Christmas. But Amanda's neighbor Arthur celebrates Hanukkah. He and Amanda's houseguest Iris bond while she's there, and Iris even throws him a Hanukkah party.</p><h3>8. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Full Court Miracle</i></a></h3><p></p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Click Here To Watch</b></a></p><p>The Disney Channel Original Movie is a cultural force, you guys. And this one is based on a true story about a washed-up former basketball star who transforms the clumsy squad at a Hebrew high school. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Full Court Miracle</i> </a>makes a decent case for the correlation between basketball and the miracle of Hanukkah.</p><p>There you have it: one movie for every night of Hanukkah.</p><p><i>Image: Columbia Pictures</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyhZZvbnBlpJ2ytLGMoZinrZugrql5zKitop2jYr2zu9WeZJygop7AtbnArGSsoJ%2BquaW602afmq6VYq6tuIytn55llqq7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-100-recap-titus-passes-the-torch-to-clarke-season-3-episode-9-stealing-fire.html><span>←</span><span>The 100 Recap Titus Passes the Torch to Clarke: Season 3 Episode 9 Stealing Fire</span></a>

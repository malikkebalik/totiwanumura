In one of the most eagerly awaited movies of 2023, the beloved characters who were first introduced in the Disney classic from 1989 make a triumphant return.</p><p>However, Producers have followed a different path from that depicted in the animated film, particularly about Ariel’s journey’s conclusion. <strong>The Little Mermaid’s ending is described below.</strong></p><h2>The Little Mermaid 2023: How Does It End?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Little-Mermaid-Box-Office-Opening-3.webp alt="The Little Mermaid ending" width=1200 height=628 title="The Little Mermaid 2023 Ending Explained: Live-Action Adaptation Ends Differently From the Original" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The magic of King Triton’s trident allows Ariel to become a human after beating Ursula so she can live happily ever after with Eric. The live-action remake offers a contemporary perspective on Ariel and Eric’s relationship and does not contain a wedding scene like the Disney classic.</p><p>King Triton (Javier Bardem) and Ariel (Halle Bailey) bid a tearful farewell in the final scene of the Rob Marshall-directed The Little Mermaid. King Triton finally realizes he must let Ariel follow her path in front of all the residents of Atlantica, who broke the tabu of living their entire lives underwater and surfaced for the occasion. Father and daughter hug before Ariel and Eric (Jonah Hauer-King) board an unidentified ship.</p><p>The Hans Christian Andersen original has a different conclusion than the Disney classic and the live-action remake. In the fairy tale from 1837, the prince marries another woman, and The Little Mermaid plots to have him murdered while he sleeps. The Little Mermaid suddenly decides against becoming a murderer, returns to the sea, and her body becomes foam.</p><p>In 1989, Disney reworked the climax into a more up-to-date, family-friendly conclusion. The Little Mermaid from 2023 tries once more to adapt to the audience’s tastes, portraying a more autonomous Ariel who isn’t necessarily tied to Eric for life through marriage.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Little-Mermaid-Box-Office-Opening-4.webp alt="The Little Mermaid ending" width=1200 height=628 title="The Little Mermaid 2023 Ending Explained: Live-Action Adaptation Ends Differently From the Original" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Read on for more information about the Little Mermaid.

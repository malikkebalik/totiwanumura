It was built back in 1999, to have "every luxury in mind" by architects Shope Reno Wharton, and sits on a lot that sprawls over more than seven privately gated acres. It's a showcase of both architecture and meticulous landscaping, and as its official listing goes on to describe, it seems to be a steal at less than $40 million:</p><p><strong>"Prized for its stately presence and sparkling limestone exterior, the majestic home captures the best of traditional architecture while integrating beautifully-scaled, light-filled interiors that delight the eye at every turn. Only the finest materials were employed throughout the home's nearly 27,000 square feet of elegant living space and the result is a tour-de-force that mixes the best of classic architecture with comfortable modern spaces perfectly suited to the way we live today. This illustrious estate represents one of the Northeast's most spectacular homes."</strong></p><p>One of the other homes near Fireman's Brookline mansion belongs to&nbsp;<a href=#>Tom Brady</a> and <a href=#>Gisele Bundchen, who also happen to be listing it for sale for $34 million</a>.</p><p>As for Fireman's home, you can take a look at it for yourself courtesy of the California Rich YouTube channel:</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK7IpaOip56WtrOxjKecsKtfp7Kmrs6kZJ%2BnpaOxpr6MqZiupF2btrOxzJqlZquclsCpsdJmp6uhk5p6sLKMm6asrJ%2Bjeqa%2F05qrnmWkpHp0hYymoKWkmaS7cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nick-fradiani-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Nick Fradiani Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>

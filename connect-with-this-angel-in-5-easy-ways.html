Because of this, we can turn to him in order to manifest our greatest wishes. He is commonly known as the archangel who can heal through music, but this fantastic angel can help us in so many ways!</p><p>Archangel Sandalphon has appeared throughout history in various religions, so you don’t need to subscribe to a specific religion to connect with him. He is in the universe to help everyone.</p><p>In this article, we will look at who Archangel Sandalphon is and the different ways we can connect with him.</p><h2 id=toc-who-is-archangel-sandalphon class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">Who Is Archangel Sandalphon?</h2><p>Archangel Sandalphon has a fascinating history. Unlike most archangels, he is said to have once been human. Many people believe that he and<a href=#> Archangel Metatron</a> were human twins, transformed into angels by God. Because of this, both of these angels have a strong link with us and are therefore easier to connect with.</p><p>Archangel Sandalphon is often referred to as the ‘tall one’ because of his stature. He is in the universe to listen to our prayers and allow us to manifest our dreams in the physical world. He is linked to everything musical, and therefore we are able to connect with him in this way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn-lkbff.nitrocdn.com/sTnyCEOWfGiIpLjCvEilsTGqVqpXJmFP/assets/images/optimized/rev-3b3f5c3/www.alittlesparkofjoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/archangel-sandalphon.jpg><p>Because Archangel Sandalphon has a deep connection with the physical world, he is also said to protect nature and the universe around us.</p><p>He allows us to see the beauty in nature and find peace and clarity in the world. He also inspires us to take care of the universe we live in, allowing us to see the importance of care for the natural world.</p><p>The connection Archangel Sandalphon has to the physical world means that he has powers of nurture and protection. When working with him, we are able to connect with the healing powers of mother nature. He is also said to be the protector of unborn babies, which means many pregnant people will turn to him for support and nurture.</p><h2 id=toc-how-to-recognize-archangel-sandalphon class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">How To Recognize Archangel Sandalphon</h2><p>There are so many archangels in the universe around us, looking out for us and being there to support us on our journey. But, because angels exist on higher <a href=# data-type=post data-id=18500>vibrational frequencies</a>, we may find it hard to recognize them!</p><p>However, when we know the signs that they are around, we are able to deepen our connection with them.</p><p>All archangels are linked to specific <a href=#>angel colors</a>, numbers, and <a href=#>angel symbols</a>. By learning which archangels are linked to what, we can begin to feel their presence in the universe.</p><p>So, how can we recognize Archangel Sandalphon?</p><h3 id=toc-archangel-sandalphon-symbol class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">Archangel Sandalphon Symbol</h3><p>Because of his connection to music, Archangel Sandalphon will often be depicted holding a musical instrument. This reminds us of the powers of melodies and tunes, and how we can find clarity and comfort in music.</p><p>Lyres, flutes, and harps are musical instruments that are commonly linked to Archangel Sandalphon. This is because they are very old and have been used by humans for centuries. If you see depictions of these instruments in the world around you, this may be because Archangel Sandalphon is around.</p><h3 id=toc-archangel-sandalphon-number class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">Archangel Sandalphon Number</h3><p>Numbers are a very common way archangels and guardian angels connect with us. This is because of the deep symbolism and energy that specific numbers have. According to numerology, everything in the universe can be broken down into numbers. Each number holds its own specific meaning.</p><p>Perhaps you have heard of <a href=#>angel numbers</a>. This is when our guardian angels put sequences of numbers in the universe around us to get our attention. They do this often, as they know that we will notice these number sequences.</p><p>Just like our guardian angels, archangels will place numbers in the universe to let us know when they are around.</p><p>Archangel Sandalphon is linked to two numbers: 0 and 9. In numerology, the number 0 represents the circle of life and completion. There is a wholeness to this number, reflecting Archangel Sandalphon’s ability to help us achieve our goals and dreams.</p><p>Similarly, the number 9 represents the end of a cycle and the beginning of a new one. It is a number of transitions and changes, again reflecting how Archangel Sandalphon helps us move forward on our path in life.</p><p>If you are seeing the number 0 or the number 9 in the universe around you, Archangel Sandalphon is probably nearby.</p><h3 id=toc-archangel-sandalphon-color class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">Archangel Sandalphon Color</h3><p>Even though archangels exist in higher realms of existence, we still can see their energy through the colors they spread in the physical world. When an archangel is around, we tend to see a specific color or light spreading through the universe around them.</p><p>Archangel Sandalphon is linked to the colors turquoise and white. When we see rays of these colors, we know that he is around.</p><p>If we are wanting to connect with Archangel Sandalphon, we can light white and turquoise candles before meditating or praying.</p><h2 id=toc-how-to-connect-with-archangel-sandalphon class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">How To Connect With Archangel Sandalphon</h2><p>Archangel Sandalphon is in the universe to help us on our path in life. However, if we are new to archangels, we may not know where to start! Unfortunately, we can’t simply pick up a phone and talk to the archangels (although that would be super useful!).</p><p>Thankfully, through meditation, prayer, and actions, we are able to connect with Archangel Sandalphon. I want to talk you through the different ways we can connect with this archangel and get help from him.</p><h3 id=toc-meditation class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">Meditation</h3><p>I will often turn to meditation when wanting to connect with specific archangels. Meditation is a great way to clear our minds, center ourselves, and open our souls up to higher energy.</p><p>Let’s look at a guided meditation I use when wanting to connect with Archangel Sandalphon. Because he is the archangel of the physical world, this meditation is designed to help you ground yourself and be present.</p><ul><li>Find a spot where you won’t be disturbed. This can be anywhere you want! Where in the world do you feel at most peace? Do you find comfort out in nature, or is there a place in your house where you feel most relaxed?</li><li>Take a moment to sit comfortably. You may also wish to lie down. The feelings of your physical body are important in this meditation, so take a while to find a relaxed position.</li><li>Close your eyes and turn your attention to your breathing. Breathe deeply through your nose and out through your mouth. As you do so, allow your thoughts to flow freely. Are you worried about the future? Are you ruminating over something in the past? Give these thoughts recognition, and then slowly release them from your mind.</li><li>As you are taking deep breaths in and out, turn your attention to your physical body. Begin at the top of your head and work down to your toes. Allow yourself to feel every part of you, recognizing any physical sensations. Take a moment to feel your connection with the earth where you are sitting. Recognize your physical presence in the world, here and now.</li><li>Repeat the words, ‘I am grounded, I am here in the universe right now’.</li><li>When you are ready, it is time to turn your attention to Archangel Sandalphon. Ask him to come to you, either out loud or in your head. Acknowledge his presence in the universe, alongside your own.</li><li>If you need to ask him for something specific, now is the time.</li></ul><p>It will take time to really get to grips with this meditation, so don’t give up if you can’t connect with him straight away!</p><h3 id=toc-crystals class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">Crystals</h3><p>All archangels are linked to specific healing crystals, as the energy of the gemstones is connected with theirs.</p><p>When we want to connect with specific archangels, we can bring crystals into our practice. Meditating with the stones or having them by our side opens us up to the archangels.</p><p>Archangel Sandalphon is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">linked to turquoise</a>. This beautiful stone purifies the energy around you, dispelling any negativity. It also is used to <a href=# data-type=post data-id=6259>align the chakras</a>, creating a feeling of calm and balance.</p><h3 id=toc-be-musical class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">Be Musical</h3><p>Because Archangel Sandalphon is linked to music, we can turn to this in order to connect with him. He loves to hear rhythms and harmonies and will send his healing energy our way when we play music.</p><p>The energy of warmth and creation that music brings us will allow us to feel Archangel Sandalphon around us. Pick up that musical instrument you have and get playing! Soon, Archangel Sandalphons energy will come to you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn-lkbff.nitrocdn.com/sTnyCEOWfGiIpLjCvEilsTGqVqpXJmFP/assets/images/optimized/rev-3b3f5c3/www.alittlesparkofjoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/how-to-connect-with-archangel-sandalphon.jpg><p>Of course, not everyone is particularly musical, and that is okay. If you don’t play an instrument, you can still connect with Archangel Sandalphon through music.</p><p>Have a think about what music makes you feel calm and at peace. This can be anything, even those pop hits you used to listen to when you were a kid!</p><p>Put on the music and turn it up, allowing the beats to flow through you. Sing along to the music (it doesn’t matter if you feel you can’t sing in tune) and allow yourself to connect with the rhythm. As you do so, keep Archangel Sandalphon in mind.</p><h3 id=toc-connect-with-nature class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">Connect With Nature</h3><p>Archangel Sandalphon is deeply connected to nature and everything physical that mother earth provides. So, we can enhance our relationship with him through nature.</p><p>When I feel distant from Archangel Sandalphon, I will often go out walking in the world. I love visiting beaches and forests to ground my energy and allow him to come to me.</p><p>When you are walking in nature, have a look at the rocks and stones that are around you. Are there any that call to you? Pick them up and hold them. This allows you to be connected with nature and therefore Archangel Sandalphon.</p><p>Branches, feathers, and twigs found in nature can also help you connect with him. Picking these items up and holding them will further your link with Archangel Sandalphon.</p><p>However, it is important to be aware of your actions and how they impact the natural world! Never pick wildflowers from nature, as this can mean they won’t grow back.</p><p>Never take anything too big from the earth if you are wanting to bring something home with you. Stick to small rocks and twigs. Remember that there are other people who want to admire them, too.</p><h3 id=toc-take-care-of-mother-earth class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">Take Care of Mother Earth</h3><p>When we want to connect with archangels, I always think it is useful to manifest their energy in our actions.</p><p>Archangel Sandalphon is said to protect nature and mother earth. So, we can be proactive in protecting the world around us when we are wanting to connect with him.</p><p>Have a think about anything you can do that helps mother earth. Are there any environmental volunteer groups nearby that you can get involved with?</p><p>Things like litter picking, community gardening, and wildlife surveying are great ways to connect with nature and therefore Archangel Sandalphon.</p><h2 id=toc-archangel-sandalphon-prayers class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">Archangel Sandalphon Prayers</h2><p>Praying is a great way to directly talk to the archangels. We can ask for their support through prayer and allow them to enter our lives.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn-lkbff.nitrocdn.com/sTnyCEOWfGiIpLjCvEilsTGqVqpXJmFP/assets/images/optimized/rev-3b3f5c3/www.alittlesparkofjoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/archangel-sandalphon-prayer.jpg><p>Let’s look at some prayers to connect with Archangel Sandalphon.</p><h3 id=toc-a-prayer-for-goals class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">A Prayer for Goals</h3><p>Archangel Sandalphon is there in the universe to help us manifest our goals and achieve our dreams.

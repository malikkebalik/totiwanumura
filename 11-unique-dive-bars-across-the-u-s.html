Well, we’ve done the legwork for you. The United States has a lot of great dive bars, but these are among the absolute best haunts to indulge in cheap drinks and good vibes.</p><h2>Snake and Jake’s Christmas Club Lounge, New Orleans</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/luna-askmen-images.askmen.com/fine_living/wine_dine_archive/snake_jakes_unique_pub_1550859716.jpg><span class=articleImgCrd>Snake & Jake's</span><p>Snake and Jake’s Christmas Club Lounge is one of the quirkiest bars in the U.S. — without a doubt. On the outside, it looks like little more than a forgotten shack, but once you step inside, you’ll find year-round Christmas lights illuminating the entire bar, alongside cheap local beers and shots. It almost feels like stepping into a high-school friend’s basement — in the best way possible.</p><h2>Sip ‘n Dip Lounge, Great Falls, Mont.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/luna-askmen-images.askmen.com/fine_living/wine_dine_archive/sip_n_dip_unique_pub_1550859760.jpg><span class=articleImgCrd>Sip 'n Dip</span><p>How do you feel about live performances? What about live mermaid performances? Sip ‘n Dip Lounge opened its doors in 1962 and has been a hit ever since. The tiki-themed bar, located in a local motel, has an indoor swimming pool with a window behind the bar, letting patrons catch a glimpse of the infamous “mermaids” swimming underwater.</p><h2>Ray’s Happy Birthday Bar, Philadelphia</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/luna-askmen-images.askmen.com/fine_living/wine_dine_archive/ray_s_happy_birthday_bar_unique_pubs_1550859789.jpg><span class=articleImgCrd>Ray's Happy Birthday Bar</span><p>Originally called Ray’s, this lovable dive bar was renamed after its original owner, Ray, passed away. According to his son and now-bar owner, Ray would greet each patron with “happy birthday” rather than hello, regardless of their date of birth. These days, you’ll find birthday cake vodka and party hats available year round.</p><h2>The Buckhorn Bar & Parlor, Laramie, Wyo.</h2><p>The Buckhorn Bar is over 100 years old and hasn’t changed a whole lot since then. Here you’ll find the bar’s famous bullet hole, a two-headed calf, elk and a whole lot of cheap booze (think $1 Jack and Coke).</p><h2>Santa’s Pub, Nashville</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/luna-askmen-images.askmen.com/fine_living/wine_dine_archive/santa_s_pub_unique_pub_1550859827.jpg><span class=articleImgCrd>GettyImages</span><p>This double wide trailer sits underneath an overpass in the more quiet side of Nashville. The menu is sparse — just PBR and Miller Lite — but insanely cheap, as in $2 a beer. In the mood for beer-drunk karaoke? That’s Santa’s speciality, but keep in mind it’s a double wide trailer, so things get cozy and friends are made fast.</p><h2>Sandbar, Juneau, Alaska</h2><p>If you find yourself looking for delicious local beer and local treats like deep fried halibut and fries, look no further than Sandbar. This no-frills resto-bar boasts more than just cheap craft beer — you’ll also find a full game room in the back, complete with a pool table, an indoor golf game machine and ample TVs.</p><h2>The Lower Depths, Boston</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/luna-askmen-images.askmen.com/fine_living/wine_dine_archive/lower_depths_unique_pub_1550859855.jpg><span class=articleImgCrd>GettyImages</span><p>This basement dive bar is located just outside of Fenway Park. Despite its prime location, you’ll still find ample cheap beer and grub options. What’s more, The Lower Depths hosts regular beer socials, where local breweries take over the pub for the night.</p><h2>The Haunt, St. Louis</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/luna-askmen-images.askmen.com/fine_living/wine_dine_archive/the_haunt_unique_pub_1550859945.jpg><span class=articleImgCrd>The Haunt</span><p>This goth-themed bar will take you back to the emo days of yesteryear — in a great way. Kitschy, Halloween decor aside, The Haunt also hosts great live music nights and offers a full — and very affordable — bar.</p><h2>Beer City, Omaha, Neb.</h2><p>Karaoke, darts, pool, cheap beer and “big ass cocktails,” Beer City is one of the most expensive dive bars on the list. But their best deal on the menu? A one-cent shots special at the end of every inning the Cubs are winning.</p><h2>The Sink, Boulder, Colo.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/luna-askmen-images.askmen.com/fine_living/wine_dine_archive/the_sink_unique_pub_1550859970.jpg><span class=articleImgCrd>GettyImages</span><p>Known for its pizza and burgers, The Sink is a great spot to stop for a beer and a bite. It’s been around for nearly 100 years, and have hosted some pretty impressive patrons — from Barack Obama to Anthony Bourdain.</p><h2>Rips Bar, Phoenix</h2><p>This old-school dive bar moves beyond kitsch and into your dad’s basement territory. The year-round Christmas lights, expired license plates, and low ceilings make it cozy on a regular night — and even cozier on karaoke night.</p><p><strong>You Might Also Dig:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7or%2FKppynZpOkunCyyKecmKSZq7avs46woKedj5m2r7G%2BmqmcoJmrsnB9kmasp6GhqrJusMivnGaakafAbq3Cq6asq12ptaZ51GaqZ6Ckork%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-jack-grealish-s-net-worth-in-2022-what-is-grealish-s-weekly-salary.html><span>←</span><span>What is Jack Grealishs net worth in 2022?

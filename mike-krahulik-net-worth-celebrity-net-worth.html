Mike Krahulik was born September 25, 1977. He is best known as being the artist for the popular webcomic Penny Arcade and is also the co-founder (with Jerry Holkins) of Child's Play, a multimillion-dollar charity that organizes toy drives for children's hospitals. Krahulik goes by the online moniker "Jonathan Gabriel" or "Gabe". Krahulik cites cartoonist Stephen Silver as a major influence on his drawing style, though his style has dramatically changed since he began drawing Penny Arcade in 1998.</p><p>Krahulik has also done promotional comics for <a href=# title="Tom Clancy Net Worth">Tom Clancy</a>'s Rainbow Six and many other video games. He has created illustrations for the cover of Agent to the Stars by John Scalzi, and in his early career he contributed artwork to the Daily Victim, a regular feature that used to run on GameSpy, totaling more than 300 illustrations. Krahulik has also been noted for his controversial opinions involving topics of transgenderism and rape, which has often resulted in polarized responses within and outside the PAX community (Penny Arcade Expo). Members of the Penny Arcade community have even turned to producing complex timelines illustrating these events to explain the social dilemmas and resultant memes. In 2013, Krahulik apologized and donated $20,000 to LGBTQ youth suicide prevention group The Trevor Project.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wK6roaeiqHyutcqeZKSqkZ3CrbXKZqWerF2svLPAx2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matt-dillon-used-the-same-gun-in-every-episode-but-1.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Matt Dillon Used the Same Gun in Every Episode but 1</span></a>

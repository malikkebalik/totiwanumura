Whenever there was a guitar around, it was never out of hand, and I was performing all the time, constantly. So, the three songwriters, John, Paul and George, were constantly hearing folk styles that maybe they hadn’t heard, maybe they hadn’t known, so they hadn’t learned them.</p><p id=par-7_79>“So, the styles I was playing came out, and when they picked up their guitars there, they were experimenting with that style,” Donovan continued. “Country-rock things that Paul was doing, and then this fingerstyle, which is the main story everybody remembers me telling. John turned around one day and said, ‘How do you do that?’ I said, ‘What?'” Donovan then taught John to play as he did, and John incorporated that style in <a href=#>songs like “Julia”</a> and <a href=#>“Dear Prudence.”</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mellow-yellow-hit-the-pop-charts-in-the-united-states-and-the-united-kingdom>‘Mellow Yellow’ hit the pop charts in the United States and the United Kingdom</h2><p id=par-8_54>“Mellow Yellow” became one of Donovan’s biggest hits in the United States.

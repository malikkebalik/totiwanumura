She was a woman with two faces. One was her public image; the other was something more deceitful.</p><p id=par-4_68><a href=#>Alma Coin</a> was the President of District 13 and helped by leading the Second Rebellion, which was against the Capitol. Though the character wasn’t completely fleshed out in the books, there were many alterations made to her character in the movie. Therefore, as the principal antagonist of the film, and she plotted ways to turn everyone against each other in the districts and the Capitol to gain power.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_44>Directors and writers shaped her as someone who would try to help others and save everyone, while she was, in fact, focused on selfish needs. This helped to make her character a driving force within the film that helped to guide the story along.</p><p id=par-6_53>Then viewers could also see that during the movie, she is quite clear about how she will sacrifice anything to gain more power, even <a href=#>Katniss Everdeen</a> (<a href=#>Jennifer Lawrence</a>). It’s clear that she cares for only herself, which is why it’s not surprising that her life ended by Everdeen’s hand before the movie ended.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-her-children-s-role-in-moore-s-involvement>Her children’s role in Moore’s involvement</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_70><a href=#>Moore’s</a> children were both in love with The Hunger Games, both as a book series and in the movies as well. Therefore, when she was offered a chance to play President Coin in the upcoming movie, she was thrilled to take the opportunity. She felt it would be meaningful to not only her, but her children, and she wanted to take part in something that they already loved so much.</p><p id=par-8_48>According to an interview posted on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NDTV</a>, Moore stated, “Most of the films I make are not for kids. My son was in line for the midnight show when&nbsp;<a href=#>The Hunger Games&nbsp;</a>first came out. They both loved the books. For them, my being in The Hunger Games:&nbsp;<a href=#>Mockingjay&nbsp;</a>was fairly meaningful”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-moore-s-children-who-are-they>Moore’s children: Who are they?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_53>Moore has two children. They are both successful actors in their own rights. The oldest child is Caleb Freundlich. He was born on December 4, 1997.

His father directed the film that gave him his acting start.</p><p id=par-10_37>Since then, he has appeared in a few other films such as Still Alice in 2014, After the Wedding in 2019, and Forty Winks in 2022. He is not only an actor but a composer as well.</p><p id=par-11_36>Liv Freundlich is Moore’s second child. She was born on April 11, 2002. She, a lot like her older brother, went into acting. Also, like her brother, her debut was in the movie Trust the Man.</p><p id=par-12_46>In the years since then, she has appeared in The Rebound, which was released in 2009.

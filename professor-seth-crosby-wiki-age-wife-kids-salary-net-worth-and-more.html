Some people who supported Palestine didn’t agree with what Crosby said, and they wanted him to lose his job.</p><p>They took pictures of what Crosby wrote on Twitter and shared them online, hoping the university would do something about it. Washington University saw these posts and decided to let Crosby go.</p><p>It is worth noting that in the past, some students had expressed the view that Hamas’ actions against Israel were a necessary measure. However, no disciplinary action was taken against these students. This raises questions about the university’s handling of freedom of speech in cases where differing viewpoints are expressed.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Seth Crosby controversial tweet" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Seth-Crosby-controversial-tweet.webp alt="Seth Crosby controversial tweet" width=400 height=233 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Fired For Controversial Comments</strong></h2><p>Seth Crosby, a seasoned professor, alleges that he was dismissed from Washington University due to a controversial post on X, where he criticized Hamas.</p><p>In an online conversation, Crosby, a geneticist with several decades of experience at the St. Louis College’s School of Medicine, mentioned Israel’s response to recent terror activities by Hamas. Crosby referred to Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip as:</p><p>“much-needed cleansing,”</p><p>Later he clarified that he wasn’t talking about ethnicity but rather addressing a specific group. However, this statement drew strong criticism from Muslim advocacy groups who felt it dehumanized Palestinians as a whole.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Seth Crosby later appologised for his controversial tweet" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Seth-Crosby-later-appologised-for-his-controversial-tweet.webp alt="Seth Crosby later appologised for his controversial tweet" width=400 height=352 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Crosby Appologised&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>After receiving criticism Seth Crosby clarified that he was only targeting Hamas and its members, not Palestinian civilians, and he issued an apology for any misunderstanding.

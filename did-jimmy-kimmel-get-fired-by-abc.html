From there, Kimmel’s sidekick, Guillermo Rodriguez, read a “statement” from the network claiming that it had decided to part ways with Kimmel after decades together, and wished him the best in the future.</p><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=339 data-injectable=false>Rodriguez followed up with a parody of Tucker Carlson being fired from Fox News, with comments advising Kimmel to not let the door hit him on the way out. Kimmel joked that it could have been worse. To be clear, this was a scripted comedy bit, not an actual firing, but that didn’t mean there wasn’t confusion online afterward.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=639 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Did Jimmy Kimmel get fired from ABC?<br>In the midst of his segment, Kimmel was interrupted by a mock "News Alert" delivered by his co-host Guillermo Rodriguez teasing that ABC fired the late night comedian. <a href=#>https://t.co/CkOLXASB9B</a></p>— Jeanne (@scoobidoo76) <a href=#>May 18, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=43 data-current-count=43 data-injectable=false>Here’s some context, for the uninitiated:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=343 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=470 data-current-count=813 data-injectable=false>So, no, Jimmy Kimmel was not really fired by ABC. For those who want to advocate for a real-life Kimmel firing, you could argue that his odd appearances in blackface earlier in his career, being rude to Megan Fox, or his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">stunt</a> with Quinta Brunson when she won her Emmy all warrant renewed investigation. But a history of comedy shenanigans in questionable taste hasn’t been enough for Jimmy Kimmel to share Tucker Carlson’s on-air fate in real life. Not yet, anyway.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yltcNmoaKlna56rLXMppylZZeawW6yyKucnWWSrnqirsJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stefania-orsola-garello-biography-age-height-husband-net-worth-family.html><span>←</span><span>Stefania Orsola Garello Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Family</span></a>

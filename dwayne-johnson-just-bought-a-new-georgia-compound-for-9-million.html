It might seem like an unusual place for a big movie star like The Rock to buy a home, but earlier this year a Facebook post from Johnson following a road trip to Macon, Georgia and through other parts of the state alluded to his fondness for out-of-the-way southern towns like the one he eventually decided to buy property in:</p><p><strong>"Funny cause it hit me yesterday as I was driving back to Atlanta, that my life is the craziest it's ever been and I didn't know much I TRULY NEEDED to go to a place where things can really slow down for me and I can just breathe and enjoy some good quality family. Hard to explain, but this was good for the soul."</strong></p><p>Powder Springs may be a small town but it's not too deep in the wilderness, reportedly about a 45-minute drive from Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta. So while he's definitely found a retreat from the Hollywood hustle and bustle, he won't be completely cut off from civilization in his new digs either.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm60zqacrGeUrK66usRmoaignqi8r3nJrqqtZZKkwqi002aYZqaVrHqosc6rnqKZXZi8rrzOrqWdZZakv26FjKagpaSZpLtw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cookielol-allegations-and-abuse-drama-explained-real-name-and-wikipedia.html><span>←</span><span>Cookielol Allegations And Abuse Drama Explained, Real Name And Wikipedia</span></a>

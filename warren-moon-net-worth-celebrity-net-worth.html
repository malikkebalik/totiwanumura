He was the middle child with six sisters, and their father died when Warren was just seven years old.

Warren Moon was named to the All-City team.</p><p>Moon enrolled at West Los Angeles College where he was a record-setting quarterback for the two-year college football team. Only a few four-year colleges showed interest in signing Moon as a quarterback, and it was the University of Washington who finally brought him in. The Washington Huskies went 11-11 in Moon's first two seasons as the starter, but as a senior he led them to the Pac-8 title and a Rose Bowl upset victory over Michigan. Warren Moon was named MVP of the game.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-227412 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Warren-Moon.jpg alt="Warren Moon Net Worth" width=462 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-227412 class=wp-caption-text>Mike Coppola/Getty Images</p><h2 id=cfl-career><strong>CFL Career</strong></h2><p>The NFL proved uninterested in drafting Warren, but the Canadian Football League grabbed him up immediately.

After connecting online, Sophie, a social media influencer, moved from London to LA to be with Rob. But when she arrived in the U.S., she was alarmed by his tiny studio apartment, which didn’t even have an attached bathroom.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_33><a href=#>Rob’s questionable living situation</a> turned out to be the least of the couple’s problems. They argued over her bisexuality, whether they should have kids, and his sexually explicit online conversations with other women.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_24>Despite their problems, Rob and Sophie did eventually tie the knot.

The couple first dated when Ashley met Manuel a decade ago while studying abroad in Ecuador. They broke up after she returned to the U.S. but reconnected years later. Manuel moved to New York to be with Ashley, where he struggled to reconcile his Catholic beliefs with her “witchy” practices of tarot and astrology. They also clashed over his relationship with his family in the U.S. and that he hadn’t introduced her to his two children, ages 12 and 14.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_47>While Ashley and Manuel faced serious obstacles in their relationship, they refused to call it quits. Their Florida wedding was seen on the Feb. 25 episode of 90 Day Fiancé.

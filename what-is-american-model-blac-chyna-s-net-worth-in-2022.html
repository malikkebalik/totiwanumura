She is said to be one of the most well-paid creators on the platform.</p><h2>Blac Chyna’s Early Years</h2><p>Angela Renee White is what Blac Chyna’s real name is. She was born on May 11, 1988, in Washington, D.C. Shalana-Jones Hunter, who goes by the name <a href=# rel=noopener>Tokyo</a> Toni, is her mother.

Blac Chyna went to high school and then went to college in Maryland.</p><h2 id=early-stripping-modeling-career>Early Stripping And Modeling Career</h2><p>Blac Chyna started stripping after college, mostly to pay for her tuition. She eventually moved to Miami to go to Johnson & Wales University, where she kept denying it while also taking classes. Soon, Blac Chyna was so tired that she couldn’t even stay awake to study. The young college student found herself in a challenging situation. She wouldn’t have enough money to pay for school if she stopped stripping. If she kept taking off her clothes, she would surely fail her classes because she kept falling asleep in class. Blac Chyna thought her only choice was to quit school and start stripping.</p><p><h2>Blac Chyna’s Relationships</h2></p><p>Tyga was the first well-known person Blac Chyna dated. Soon after the model was in the rapper’s music video, they started dating. In 2011, they started going out together, and by 2012, they had a son. In the end, Tyga bought a house for the new family, but the relationship didn’t last. In 2014, they broke up, and Tyga became interested in <a href=# rel=noopener>Kylie Jenner</a> as a new love interest.</p><p>After she broke up with Tyga, Blac Chyna and Kylie Jenner fought openly on social media. Even though this would make her and the <a href=# rel=noopener>Kardashians</a> fight, Blac Chyna would eventually make up with the family. In 2016, she started dating Rob Kardashian, and she and the rest of the Kardashian family became close.</p><p>Kim Kardashian and the model are said to have become very close friends. Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian had a daughter together in the second half of 2016. The couple broke up about a month after the child was born. They would eventually get back together for a short time, but it seemed like the relationship wasn’t meant to last. Since they broke up, the two parents have been fighting over who gets to keep their daughter. Rob Kardashian posted sexually explicit pictures of his ex-girlfriend on social media, which made Blac Chyna file a restraining order against him.</p><p>Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna had a custody battle, showing how much she makes. Court documents say Blac Chyna makes most of her $60,000 monthly from personal appearances and social media endorsements. Rob Kardashian also gave her $20,000 a month in spousal support, but since he no longer appears on “Keeping Up with the Kardashians,” his income has decreased and he has moved to cut or stop these payments.</p><h2>Television</h2><p>Blac Chyna has been on several reality TV shows as herself. These include Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Rob & Chyna, Rupaul’s Drag Race, Good Morning America, The Real, The Wendy Williams Show, RuPaul, and more. Many of these roles were short cameos in one or two episodes, but she also starred in a reality show called The Real Blac Chyna, which was all about her life.</p><h2>Business Ventures</h2><p>Blac Chyna has tried her hand at several businesses besides stripping, modeling, and TV work. In 2013, Blac Chyna went to school to learn how to do makeup for a living. The famous person owns her beauty salon in Encino, Los Angeles, where she teaches beauty classes.

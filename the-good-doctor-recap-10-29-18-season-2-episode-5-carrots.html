He talks about the apartment he rented and how sometimes feelings change, but thinks living together will be awkward. She reminds him of how unhappy they were when they weren’t getting along and anything putting their friendship at risk isn’t worth it to her. He seems to understand but walks out.</p><p>Dr. Audrey Lim (Christina Chang) shares with Dr. Alex Park (Will Yun Lee) and Shaun that their gall bladder surgery is canceled and wants to see if there is something more interesting up. Shaun finds a foamy urine sample, saying, “this is interesting!”</p><p>Dr. Claire Browne (Antonia Thomas) is in the ED when her patient comes in and falls unconscious again. Claire attempts to restart her heart by punching her fist to her chest, but cracks her sternum instead; her husband Sam Deleon (David Lewis) tells her that his wife caused the frailty to herself, sharing that she is anorexic.</p><p>Shaun and Alex go to see their patient, revealing they need to do a cystoscopy. He asks Shaun what that is and he informs him it is a procedure where put a camera inside his bladder to see what is going on; Alex asks Shaun to clear it with Dr. Lim.</p><p>Claire and Dr. Neil Melendez (Nichloas Gonzalez) inform their anorexic patient that she need heart surgery, as one of her valves is leaking. Her husband reveals this last bout started about a year and a half ago, but she has been suffering from it since she was fourteen. Her son arrives and his dad promises the doctor are going to help her.</p><p>Shaun visits Dr. Aaron Glassman (Richard Schiff) insisting he needs to walk a full lap of the floor, in order to start the discharge process. Shaun is worried about him staying in the hospital any longer than he needs to, saying he has 8 minutes until his procedures and wants to walk with Aaron; but he tells Shaun to be early instead.</p><p>Lim tells Shaun that since he found the patient, he can have the honors of doing the procedure; guiding him on how to do it. Shaun informs them that the contrast has vanished and they realize he probably has a fistula. Meanwhile, Claire tells Melendez and Dr. Morgan Reznick (Finoa Gubelmann) that their patient is severely malnourished, she needs the surgery to survive but is too sick to have the surgery. They talk to her about her options, as Claire knows this isn’t about food, its about control; Claire wants to know how she was able to have a child and she explains how she would look at her ultrasound and picture the food going directly to him. Claire asks if she would eat again for Graham?</p><p>Dr. Lim tells their patient, the fistula was caused by Crohn’s Disease and they need to reverse his gastric bypass surgery. Alex is surprised his husband, Spence doesn’t know about about it and Shaun says Spence must be really shallow. Lim worries about the scars as Alex refuses to lie but Shaun figures out a way to deceive him.</p><p>Morgan asks Graham to leave, but he overhears Morgan and chastises his mother saying he knew she was too skinny and that is why she is there and that is probably why her heart is messed up. He tells her to prove she cares and do something about it. Claire confronts Morgan about provoking that argument, but she doesn’t care as long as she gets results.</p><p>Alex and Lim debate truth inside the marriage; but Shaun says marriage sounds confusing, it’s no wonder they both failed at it! Claire returns to see that their patient has accepted the feeding tube, she feels awkward but her husband says he is really proud of her.</p><p>Shaun finds Dr. Marina Blaize (Lisa Edelstein) informing her about Aaron’s lack of bowel movement. He wants her to order physical therapy and exlax. She says Aaron is a proud man and won’t do the therapy and suggests he should tell Aaron that; but when he tells her he already did, she tells him to use a carrot instead of a stick. Shaun is confused and says Aaron doesn’t like carrots and asks how he should use a stick. She explains the metaphor as he continues to get messages; she tells him to get them and he rushes off.</p><p>Alex and Shaun rush in to see their patient is projectile vomiting, Spence wants to know if Crohn’s could cause the bowel obstruction and Alex doesn’t know how to respond. Claire returns, telling her patient she is doing great; but she shares that her head won’t stop. Claire encourages her to think of Sam and Graham, but as soon as she turns she yanks out the tube saying she can’t do it.</p><p>Lea tells Shaun she got his deposit back. He is mad because he feels they can still be friends with benefits, meaning they can live together. She was clear as they cannot date, kiss nor have sex; but they can live together.</p><p>Morgan and Claire meet with Melendez who can’t run the risk of self injury by forcing the tube inside and having her in restraints. Melendez wants to do the surgery now but Claire suggests they do a brain surgery as Melendez reviews the results saying it could change her personality completely. She fights for it, but he says its not a real option as it has only been used in the UK and not for anorexia. He tells them to prepare to talk to her about the valve operation.</p><p>Shaun goes to the hospital cafeteria, looking for a carrot. Debbie Wexler (Sheila Kelley) tells him she has lemon poppy muffin but he explains its a metaphor for moving a donkey. He needs a carrot because he doesn’t want to beat Dr. Glassman with a stick. He explains that Aaron moved his bowels this morning but he doesn’t want to appear weak and buys a chocolate chip muffin for Aaron.</p><p>Spence finds Alex in the cafeteria, saying he researched treatment about Crohn’s lesions and spoke to 2 experts who suggest he should be on medication before surgery. Alex blurts out they are not treating Crohn’s and he should talk to his husband.</p><p>Shaun tells Aaron about the muffin and it’s at the nurses’ station and they can go get it together. Aaron says he is manipulating him as his leg hurts; telling Shaun he is condescending and annoying. Shaun suggests getting his muffin, but when he gets to the door he tells Aaron an orderly is eating it. Sam finds Melendez that his wife is refusing the valve surgery until she has tried the deep brain stimulation for her anorexia; he assures him that Dr. Browne has explained all the risks and issues.</p><p>Shaun wakes up Lea, saying he got their apartment back but had to pay $300 more. She is frustrated as he explains he will be okay living with her. He says living with her is good for him because it makes him happy. She reminds him of what he said about the unpredictable future and doesn’t want to risk their future over an apartment. He says if they don’t live together, she will have to to buy her own batteries. She promises they will still see each other if they don’t live together. He says he will stop on the way to work and tell the manager they don’t want the apartment, but she says she will do it.</p><p>Claire explains DBS procedure to Dr. Marcus Andrews (Hill Harper), Allegra Aoki (Tamlyn Tomita) and Dr. Melendez. Andrews is concerned but Claire wants them to hear from the patient herself; Melendez objects as she informs him they are less likely to get sued if they listen. She explains how she is literally killing herself and can’t stop on her own, begging them to help her stop. She is aware of all the risks and understands that she might lose her love for her son by overcoming her eating disorder. She is willing to risk everything for her son to see her succeed as he has been watching her starve herself to death for the past year.</p><p>Lim talks to Alex, who lets him know that Wade knows he told Spence the truth. Wade has demanded a transfer to another hospital. Spence feels Wade kept it a secret because he thinks he is shallow, Shaun openly thought the same thing. Wade reveals the way Spence treats a couple of their friends is the reason he didn’t tell him. Shaun realizes he is bleeding internally and Wade needs surgery now.</p><p>Dr. Browne learns her surgery has been approved and Dr. Andrews hopes her procedure goes well.</p><p>Shaun tells Alex during surgery that maybe Wade felt Spence would feel the same way Alex did, that he lost the weight the easy way. Dr. Lim looks at Alex. Meanwhile, Graham tells him mom he loves her and she reassures him she will be okay and loves him more than anyone on the planet.</p><p>Shaun returns to see Dr. Blaize telling her the chocolate chip muffin didn’t work, the donkey won’t walk. He insists Aaron isn’t embarrassed and Shaun feels he needs help recovering and Dr. Glassman got angry at him. Shaun doesn’t know what to do and he is her patient. She tells Shaun that Aaron needs a support friend and he knows th perfect person, running out of her office again, leaving the door open.</p><p>Claire’s patient wakes up, feeling like she wants something to eat. Graham hugs his mother and Sam wants to bring him home for a good night sleep. Once they leave, Claire learns that the hug was different for her.</p><p>Alex tells Spence that Wade’s surgery went well and he’s awake. Spence shares photos of Wade before he had his bypass and Alex honestly tells him it is possible that Wade might end up like that again; Spence wishes he didn’t know that and walks away.</p><p>Debbie Wexler comes to see Aaron, saying that Shaun thought he could use the visit. She apologizes for being out of touch and he says he dropped the ball because of his brain tumor. She pulls back his blankets and tells him they are going for a walk, revealing she has spent some time as a nurse and puts his slippers on.</p><p>Claire goes to see Melendez, saying she came from Louisa’s room and she is eating. He feels that is great news and hopefully they can do the valve repair in few weeks. He says she won’t be involved in that or any of his surgeries as she went around him. He tells her that he didn’t get Dr. Andrews; he expects his residents to argue passionately for their position but they need to accept his decision, even when he is wrong. She is upset when he says he cannot run his team any other way.</p><p>Aaron and Debbie are walking the floor, as Shaun watches from the corner. Dr. Blaize tells Shaun he did a good job, but he says it was Debbie who is a better carer than he is. Outside, Alex calls his ex to make sure the check got there okay and has a question about Phil, wondering what might have happened if he hasn’t seen them together.</p><p>Shaun returns and Lea tells him she found her next apartment. It has a fireplace, natural lighting and a great roommate who is a good friend who works a lot as she might not see him much. She is talking about Shaun. She agrees that if he says he can handle this she is going to trust him. He gets excited, and they jump up and down, celebrating that they are going to be roommates.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaHFnpJ2ybrPOqJtmnJ%2BYwbC%2BjKucnJmgYn5xeZFyZGpwXaiyor%2FOp2RrZZWltrS7w55kbmWTlr%2Bzu9OsZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ren%C3%A9e-taylor-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Rene Taylor Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>

While on their <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>honeymoon in Jamaica</a>, Jasmine blushed and pleaded the fifth when her new husband asked about her “favorite sexual position” over a candlelit dinner. “My wife, you know, she’s a little bit more reserved, but I feel like she’s got a demon side. I’ve gotta kinda pull that demon side out of her,” Airris, who had joked earlier about his “years of research” on the topic, told cameras. “That’s gonna be fun. I’ve never been, like, a sex mentor, but I can show her the ways. I'll just add that on my résumé.”</p><p>Though their interaction was playful, different views on attraction and comfort with physicality caused major issues, leading Airris and Jasmine to break up and divorce on the show. During the MAFS Season 16 reunion, they agreed that Airris’ lack of attraction to Jasmine was a key contributor to their marriage’s failure. She wasn’t on board with his idea of having an open marriage either, and both agreed that they ultimately weren’t a compatible match. In their sitdown with host Kevin Frazier, Jasmine revealed that she’s now in a relationship, while Airris said that he’s currently single.</p><p>Prior to Airris and Jasmine’s breakup, some fans had already predicted the split while the show was airing. Many took issue with how Airris “allowed” his cousin to treat Jasmine poorly. (He apologized to Jasmine during the reunion.) Others pointed to another incident when Jasmine caught her then-husband dancing with another woman at a bar. Meanwhile, the show highlighted that Airris had been unfaithful in a prior serious relationship, and showed the 39-year-old software engineer and instructor insisting that he was “done with the streets” and ready to be a one-woman man — even if he has to share his new wife’s attention with her 13 dogs.</p><p></p><p>That wasn’t the only issue for the 32-year-old Nashville cheerleading coach, though. During a <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>MAFS after-show</a> interview, she explained to host Keshia Knight Pulliam that it “definitely raised [her] eyebrow a little bit” to find out that Airris hadn’t been in many serious relationships, nor had he ever lived with a woman. As an only child, Airris valued having his own space, something that didn’t help their circumstances. Meanwhile, Airris’ cousin, Fallina, was staunchly against his decision to get married, and she grilled Jasmine about the fact she was living with another man just seven months prior to their wedding day.</p><p>Because <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Airris’</a> and <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Jasmine’s Instagram</a> accounts are set to private, there are no additional social media clues about where the couple might stand today. However, “hopeless romantic” Jasmine previously told Distractify in January, “I’m in a place in life where I feel the <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>only thing missing is my person</a>,” and her use of the present tense seemed to be a telling indicator. The former pageant queen continued by emphasizing an issue that brought her on the show in the first place. “I always fall in love with potential. I see the good in people and I’m that person that wants to always help my partner reach their full potential,” she added. “Eventually, I realize that’s not what they want for themselves and I’m back at square one.”</p><p>Still, Airris’ interview seemed to hint that they at least ended on a positive note. “Between work, adjusting to marrying a stranger, and constantly being filmed, [it] did become overwhelming at times,” he recalled of the MAFS experience. “Jasmine and I relied on each other a lot when the filming aspect became too stressful for one of us. There was not a time where I felt that I would walk away during the entire process.”</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p>This article was originally published on Feb. 1, 2023</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZpqqlWKuqr7RoqpmopGouqq6xGaqraGcoXq1u8aeq6GdomKup8DEq2SmmaKntqawjJqrZp6Zp8C1edKinqGs</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-good-doctor-recap-10-29-18-season-2-episode-5-carrots.html><span>←</span><span>The Good Doctor Recap 10/29/18: Season 2 Episode 5 Carrots</span></a>

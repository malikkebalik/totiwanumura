We saw it with <a href=#>Bruce Lee</a>, we saw it with <a href=# title="Michael Jackson Net Worth">Michael Jackson</a>, and we saw it with <a href=# title="Kurt Cobain Net Worth">Kurt Cobain</a>, but the fallen idol who exemplifies this idea more than any one is <a href=#>Tupac</a>. He's released so much posthumous material that many quasi-jokingly believe he's secretly alive, and he even came back as a hologram – but now things have reached a new level of ghoulishness with the listing of the infamous 1996 BMW 750IL he was shot in being listed for sale.</p><p>According to TMZ, high-priced auction house Moments In Time has listed the car for sale, but instead of putting it up for auction, they've listed it at a flat $1.5 million (what happens if they do get multiple offers remains to be seen). The car has been restored to much of its "former glory" before that fateful night in September of 1996, but close examination reportedly reveals indentations left over from bullet holes in the panels of the doors.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-216466 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/GettyImages-142964555.jpg alt width=900 height=638 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-216466 class=wp-caption-text>Christopher Polk/Getty Images for Coachella</p><p>How did Moments In Time end up having <a href=# title="Tupac Net Worth">Tupac</a>'s death car to sell in the first place? After the murder was committed, the BMW was in the possession of the Las Vegas Police Department, and it's actually been auctioned off multiple times, bouncing from owner to another&nbsp;in the last two decades. Now, it will find its latest owner – personally, my money is on <a href=#>Martin Shkreli</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnCvwKdkqa2imLWiv8RmmpqqXanCsa3CZqqhp6Rifm6BjKagpaSZpLtw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-macallan-40-limited-edition-sherry-oak-scotch-runs-eight-grand-a-bottle.html><span>←</span><span>The Macallan 40: Limited Edition Sherry Oak Scotch Runs Eight Grand A Bottle</span></a>

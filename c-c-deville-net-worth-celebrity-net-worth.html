In 1991, backstage at the MTV Awards, DeVille was involved in a fist fight with Poison's lead singer <a href=#>Bret Michaels</a> after DeVille played the wrong song during the performance. He was accused of being 'high and intoxicated' during the performance and was subsequently asked to leave and replaced by Ritchie Kotzen.

Ultimately, he was selected over the other finalist, who happened to be future Guns N' Roses guitarist <a href=#>Slash</a>. With DeVille on board, the band went on to sign with Enigma Records and release its debut album, 1986's "Look What the Cat Dragged In." Although not an immediate hit, the album built momentum and made it to number three on the Billboard 200 by 1987. It also launched the successful singles "Talk Dirty to Me," "I Want Action," and "I Won't Forget You." Poison had its greatest hit with its second album, "Open Up and Say… Ahh!"

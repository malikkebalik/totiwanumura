It was not until several years later that she recorded the song with her new producer Tony Brown.</p><p id=par-8_19>Originally written and recorded by Gentry in 1970, “Fancy” was a follow-up to Gentry’s “Ode to Billie Joe.”</p><p id=par-9_19>As pointed out by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Country Thang Daily</a>, both songs began as short stories and are considered Southern Gothic narratives.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fancy-singer-Reba-McEntire.jpg><p id=par-10_87>“Fancy” tells the story of a destitute 18-year-old girl living with her mother and baby sibling outside New Orleans, Louisiana. When the money runs out, Fancy’s mother sends her out to earn a living and provide for the family as a sex worker. She tells Fancy “Here’s your chance, Fancy, don’t let me down/Here’s your one chance, Fancy, don’t let me down/Lord, forgive me for what I do/But if you want out, well, it’s up to you/Now don’t let me down now/Your mama’s gonna move you uptown.”</p><p id=par-11_55>Fancy does as she’s told, but turns her devastating reality into a hard-won victory. This fuels her own independence and financial freedom. The song ends with the fictional Fancy, now the owner of a “Georgia mansion and an elegant New York townhouse flat” who “ain’t had to worry ‘bout nothing for nigh on fifteen years.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Fancy’ is still considered one of Reba McEntire’s best songs</h2><p id=par-12_30>Like Gentry, who called “Fancy” her “strongest statement for women’s lib,” according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ms. Magazine</a>, so too does McEntire’s singing of the song evoke a sense of female empowerment.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-13_43>For her original version, recorded in 1990, McEntire built upon Gentry’s more swinging original work adding a powerful choir to the song’s chorus. McEntire also starred in a dramatic six-minute music video that brought the story to life in a new, theatrical way.</p><p id=par-14_39>The song was not a No. 1 hit for Gentry or McEntire. But “Fancy” lives on as one of the most iconic country songs ever written and is considered one of the songs for which McEntire is best known.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS%2Fpq7AZqScnZ6ptrOxjJ6vqaSRnru0edahsGaekaOwunnApa6asaNisK270qKloGWjpLuoesetpKVn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./neil-aspinall-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Neil Aspinall Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>

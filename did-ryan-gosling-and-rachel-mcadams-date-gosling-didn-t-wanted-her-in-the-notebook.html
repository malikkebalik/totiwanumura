Gosling Didnt Wanted Her in The Notebook</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>The 41-year-old Canadian actor <a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a> who has worked in several successful films including 2011’s rom-com “Crazy, Stupid, Love,” 2017’s “Blade Runner 2049” and the 2016 Oscar-winning film titled “La La Land.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Ryan Gosling has also gathered attention for his chemistry with Rachel McAdams in the 2004 romantic drama film titled “The Notebook” which was inspired by the novel of the same title written by Nicholas Sparks. Their on-screen chemistry was loved by audiences leading people to speculate that they were sharing off-screen romance as well however it didn’t appear so.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Read the full article below to know Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams’ on set rough relationship as shared by Nick Cassavetes.</span></p><h2><b>Ryan Gosling Didn’t Want Rachel McAdams in The Notebook</b></h2><p><span>The character Noah and Allie share a love-hate relationship in The Notebook depicted by splits and patch-ups before their happy ending. <strong>Ryan and McAdams weren’t actually on good terms</strong> while filming for the film.</span></p><p><span>According to the report from “Daily Mail,” in a 2014 interview with VH1 the director Nick Cassavetes revealed that there was tension on set. He said “Maybe I’m not supposed to tell this story but they were really not getting along one day on set. Really not,” continuing that while filming a sequence with McAdams and 150 others, <strong>Ryan pulled him aside asking for another actor to be brought in</strong> to read with him off-camera which shocked Nick. Ryan further continued “I can’t. I can’t do it with her. I’m just not getting anything from this.”</span></p><h2><b>Nick Cassavetes had to conduct a “Therapy Session” with the Co-stars</b></h2><p><span>After realizing the intensity of the problem, Cassavetes a producer McAdams and Gosling moved for a private discussion where as said by Nick: “They started screaming and yelling at each other.”</span></p><p><span>Fortunately after “they had it out,” the situation was under control. Nick added that Gosling respected McAdams’ wants to “stand up for her character.”</span></p><p><span><strong>Ryan and McAdams’ professional relationship improved</strong> after they expressed their feelings however it wasn’t wholly “smooth sailing” for the rest of the shooting as confirmed by Cassavetes.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ryan-Gosling-And-Rachel-McAdams.jpg><h2><b>Things Improved After Gosling and McAdams Started dating in Reality</b></h2><p><span>While the two started roughly as co-stars, <a href=# rel=noopener>Ryan Gosling</a> and McAdams eventually fell in love with each other in real life. Following the filming for The Notebook completed, they were in an on-and-off relationship for 2 years and in 2007 they broke up officially.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Though in The Notebook we see them happily ever after in reality the couple couldn’t achieve that. In a 2007 interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">GQ</a> when Gosling was questioned regarding the split he responded by saying “The only thing I remember is we both went down swingin’ and we called it a draw.”</span></p><p><span>A woman even asked Gosling how he could get over McAdams, to which he answered “I feel like I want to give people hugs they seem so sad. Rachel and I should be the ones getting hugs! Instead, we’re consoling everybody else,” <strong>later he called McAdams “one of the great loves of my life.”</strong></span></p><p><span>Ryan may not have been delighted during the filming of The Notebook but it looks like his perception has changed now in an interview with GQ following their split, he said “I mean, God bless The Notebook. It introduced me to one of the great loves of my life.”</span></p><p><span>Despite their relationship could not last for long, both of them found their soulmates in some other person. Gosling has been in a relationship with <a href=# rel=noopener>Eva Mendes</a> since 2011 and the couple also welcomed two daughters together the first named Esmerelda (2014) and Amada (2016).</span></p><p><span>McAdams has been in a relationship with screenwriter Jamie Linden since 2016 and the couple also has a son together born in 2018. McAdams also announced their second pregnancy in&nbsp; <strong>August 2020</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Final Words</b></p><p><span>Well, though Ryan Gosling and McAdams’ relationship couldn’t work, the two are happy in their respective lives.

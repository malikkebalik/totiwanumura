He was very close to his mother, Sharon, and when she had a stroke in December 2014, Tucker rushed to New York from Atlanta to be with her. Todd was with Sharon when she passed away, and later that day, he shared a photo of the two of them on Instagram, captioned "Today I lost my partner, my ride or die my best friend! I don't know what to do? My heart hurts so much! She was a fighter, a warrior for her son! It was me and her against the world! She's in a better place!! Mom I love you to death! Rest in peace!"</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Tucker has served as a line producer on the TV series "BET News" (2008) and an executive producer on "Hollywood Divas" (2014), "My Super Sweet 16" (2015), and "Kandi Koated Nights" (2018).

Eventually they decided to announce their involvement with each other and expected to have to leave the show. Instead of being fired, Tucker was offered a place in the cast, and subsequently joined a different Bravo show as production manager. Todd has had a strained relationship with Kandi's mother, Mama Joyce, since he and Burruss began to get serious, and the ups and downs of their relationship have played out on the show.</p><p>Todd and Kandi married on April 4, 2014, and their wedding was documented for the five-part special "Kandi's Wedding," which aired on Bravo in June 2014. The couple welcomed son Ace on January 6, 2016, and daughter Blaze (via a surrogate) on November 22, 2019. Tucker also has a daughter, Kaela (born June 17, 1996) from a previous relationship, and he is stepfather to Riley (born August 22, 2002), Burruss's daughter from her relationship with Russell "Block" Spencer.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>Todd and Kandi live in a 7,000+ square foot mansion in Atlanta that features seven bedrooms, 9.5 baths, a piano room, a gigantic living room, and an indoor pool. Though Burruss paid just $503,000 for the home in 2012, it was estimated to be worth more than $1 million when she bought it, and it has undergone more than $200,000 in renovations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97wa6qoqaVqMBusdeemq6smauytHvTqJudZaSqsKyx0WalnqxdrLyzwMdo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stephen-amell-shares-new-look-at-green-arrow-s-season-8-costume.html><span>←</span><span>Stephen Amell Shares New Look At Green Arrows Season 8 Costume</span></a>

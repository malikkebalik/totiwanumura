Brian was the creative mastermind behind the Beach Boys’ songs, while dad Murry Wilson served as the band’s manager.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_57>At the time, the Beach Boys were noted as one of the few American rock groups that not only performed their songs but wrote them, too. They were also one of the few American groups to continue their success after the British Invasion brought <a href=#>the Beatles</a>, the Rolling Stones, and countless other UK acts to the US.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Beach Boys had just four No. 1 hits</h2><p id=par-4_41>Even though the Beach Boys have sold over 100 million records worldwide, the band has just four No.1 singles to their name. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Billboard</a>, the first one came in 1964, with “I Get Around” from their album All Summer Long.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_31><strong>“I Get Around”</strong> was No. 1 for two weeks and remained on the charts for 15 total weeks.

It was the group’s first original Top 20 single in 20 years, as well as their first No. 1 single in 22 years.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_40>“Kokomo” was No. 1 for one week, with a total of 28 weeks on the charts. It was also the band’s longest-charting single, with second place going to “Surfin’ U.S.A,” a 1963 single that peaked in the third place slot.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3><p lang=en dir=ltr>Podcast bucket list moment: The lead singer of "The Beach Boys", Mike Love, sings with the crowd, "Kokomo" the #1 hit in history for the Beach Boys, on my podcast. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/L7HJNPBE1w</a></p>— James Altucher (@jaltucher) <a href=#>July 30, 2019</a></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Other high-charting songs from the Beach Boys</h2><p id=par-10_47>Although just a few songs went No. 1, the Beach Boys still had plenty of hit songs that almost made it to the top of the charts. “Barbara Ann,” a 1966 single, went to No. 2, while “California Girls” and “Sloop John B” peaked at No. 3.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_50>The Beach Boys are still hugely popular today, with Love going on tour with an ever-changing lineup of musicians and singers.

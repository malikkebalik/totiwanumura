In his Sept. 10 start in Cleveland, he did not allow a hit until there were two outs in the eighth inning when <a href=# class="player-linker-link mce-player-linker">Austin Hedges</a> hit a groundball single to right.</p><p>Singer, who was drafted 18th overall in 2018 out of Florida, wasn’t the only Royals rookie pitcher to shine. A fellow 2018 draft pick joined Singer in the rotation.</p><p>Lefthander <a href=# class="player-linker-link mce-player-linker">Kris Bubic</a>, who led the minors with 185 strikeouts in 2019, struck out 8.8 per nine innings to set a Royals rookie for those with at least 10 starts.</p><p>Bubic, a supplemental first-rounder out of Stanford, yielded two or fewer runs in seven of his 10 starts. The 23-year-old recorded a 4.32 ERA in 50 innings, striking out 49 and walking 22.</p><p>In the Royals’ bullpen, a rookie flamethrower emerged after five seasons of of untamed wildness in the minor leagues, the last three at Triple-A.</p><p><a href=# class="player-linker-link mce-player-linker">Josh Staumont</a>, a 2015 second-round pick out of Azusa Pacific, struck out 37 in 25.2 innings while recording a 2.45 ERA in 26 appearances.</p><p>Staumont averaged 98 mph and hit 100 regularly, while throwing a wicked, high-spin curveball in the low 80s. Opposing hitters managed just .172 with 18 strikeouts in at-bats ending with a curve.</p><p>Control remains a concern for Staumont, who walked 5.6 per nine innings as a rookie after averaging 7.0 per nine in the minors.</p><p>“The most important thing is the transition of some of our young pitchers and a bullpen that has emerged and given us a lot of hope,” Royals general manager Dayton Moore said. “There’s some things to build around.”</p><p><strong>ROYALTIES</strong></p><p>— Rookie righthander <a href=# class="player-linker-link mce-player-linker">Kyle Zimmer</a>, a 2012 first-round pick, demonstrated waht he can do when healthy. He logged a 1.57 ERA in 16 relief appearances, but keeping Zimmer healthy remains an issue. He went on the 60-day injured list the final week of the season with right elbow ulnar neuritis with numbness and tingling in his fingertips.</p><p>— Righthander Alex Marsh, who was a second-round pick in 2019 out of Arizona State, was a late addition to the Royals’ alternate site. Marsh stayed active by making three appearances in the independent Constellation Energy League.</p><p>— The Royals also sent two other righthanders to their alternate site at the T-Bones’ park in Kansas City, Kan. Both were 2018 draft picks. They were righthander <a href=# class="player-linker-link mce-player-linker">Jon Heasley</a>, a 13th-rounder out of Oklahoma State, and second-rounder <a href=# class="player-linker-link mce-player-linker">Jonathan Bowlan</a> out of Memphis.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o63SnpmapJyWuqa%2ByJyYZ5ufony0wM6roJ6rX5e%2ForDYZqqippeav26%2BzrKYpatdZ31zfIyrpqijmZp6sLKMrZ%2BeZamarrN7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./billionaire-david-geffen-sells-malibu-home-for-85-million.html><span>←</span><span>Billionaire David Geffen Sells Malibu Home For $85 Million</span></a>

He's nominated for seven <a href=#>Grammy Awards</a> (which will be handed out on January 28th), he's producing the upcoming&nbsp;Black Panther&nbsp;soundtrack, and his publishing deal with&nbsp;Warner/Chappell Music is about to expire right as he's hitting a new peak in his career and global superstardom. According to&nbsp;Billboard, that position has its financial benefits, and the rapper's management at&nbsp;Top Dawg Entertainment are considering offers for a new publishing deal that are reported to range in value between $20 million and $40 million.</p><p>The value of the deal depends not just on who places the winning bid, but the precise terms of what the label in question would be getting for their money as well. But since Lamar is still in the negotiation phase, none of those precise terms are open for public consumption as of yet. As&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;puts it:</p><p>"One bidder has offered $28 million, a source tells&nbsp;Billboard, while another source cited a $23 million offer that included $11 million upon signing. Such offers would likely be for Lamar's entire catalog, but the terms Lamar's camp is seeking weren't clear."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-245663 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GettyImages-847179946.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-245663 class=wp-caption-text>Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images]</p><p>Lamar finds himself a free agent during a time that the climate is very favorable towards successful songwriters. In the old days, an artist's back catalog including hit records such as Lamar's, would typically go for about ten times the catalog's net publishing share, or NPS. In today's industry, that figure has ballooned to 12 and as high as 16 times the NPS, which is part of the reason Lamar is able to command such high figures (and such a wide range of offers to choose from).</p><p>Lamar's latest album&nbsp;DAMN.,&nbsp;was the Billboard 200 top album of 2017, and was certified double Platinum by the RIAA in July.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnC3xKebq6GToHqtrcyaqWaskaG4tHnNnq5mqKWXuaq%2Fx6KloGWUmq6tedaoqa2gXWd9boCPZqSipJyevK97</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shantel-charlo-wiki-jermall-charlo-s-wife-bio-age-relationship-children-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Shantel Charlo: Wiki (Jermall Charlos Wife), Bio, Age, Relationship, Children, Net Worth</span></a>

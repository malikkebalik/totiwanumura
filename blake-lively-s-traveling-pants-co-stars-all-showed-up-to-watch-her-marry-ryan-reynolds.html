However, before they got together, both Lively and Reynolds had quite the name and career for themselves. As for Reynolds, the 44 year-old Canadian has been celebrated for his work in films like Just Friends and The Proposal. While working on the set of Green Lantern, a 2011 movie, Reynolds first met <a href=#>Lively</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-2_96>Many people remember Lively as one of the OGs from CW’s Gossip Girl. Although, before Lively took on the part of Serena van der Woodsen, there was one other role her fans probably remember her from fondly. That is, of course, Bridget from the one-and-only The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. Though the movie premiered all the way back in 2005, all of Lively’s co-star’s from the popular film attended the actress’ small and intimate wedding with Reynolds. Take a glance back at the momentous occasion and the stars from The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-blake-lively-s-the-sisterhood-of-the-traveling-pants-co-stars-all-showed-up-to-watch-her-marry-ryan-reynolds>Blake Lively’s ‘The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants’ co-stars all showed up to watch her marry Ryan Reynolds&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/blake-lively.jpg><p id=par-3_62>Before it was a film, the title actually was a book. Ann Brashares was the author behind <a href=#>The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants</a>. As the story went, four friends found a pair of pants that somehow, despite their differences, fit them all perfectly. Even when the close knit-group of friends couldn’t be with one another, the pants kept them connected and together.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_61>The 2005 film marked Lively’s breakout role, and alongside the Gossip Girl star was America Ferrera, Amber Tamblyn, and Alexis Bledel. Though the actresses were just taking on fictional roles, the real-life bonds they formed definitely seemed to reflect the characters they played. Afterall, Ferrera, Tamblyn, and Bledel all attended Lively’s 2012 wedding that only included 35 people. Talk about VIP.</p><p id=par-5_33><a href=#>E!</a> has recapped many of the behind-the-scenes details from the memorable day, but take a look back at one of Lively’s very first roles and the stars who appeared on screen with her.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-bridget-vreeland>Bridget Vreeland&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-6_30>In <a href=#>The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants</a>, Lively took on the part of Bridget Vreeland. Bridget, amongst other things, was known for her love for soccer and her extreme impulsiveness.</p><p id=par-7_47>Bridget, or “Bee” as her friends and family called her, didn’t have the best relationship with her dad and lost her mother to mental illness at a young age. Navigating high school without a mom, Bridget always seemed grateful to be able to turn to her girlfriends.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-tibby-rollins>Tibby Rollins</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-8_39>Marching to the beat of her own drum was the one-and-only Tibby Rollins. Seemingly unbothered yet deeply loyal, Tibby was a real one. Tamblyn was cast as Tibby and did an excellent job of bringing the character to life.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_31>Tibby’s blue hair streaks and passion for film captured her essence perfectly. More recently, Tamblyn’s fans and followers have gotten to enjoy watching her in Drunk History and Inside Amy Schumer.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-carmen-lowell>Carmen Lowell&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-10_52><a href=#>Ferrera</a> was the talented actress who took on Carmen’s character. In The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, Carmen was known to be a bit of a perfectionist. Much of her storyline stemmed from her parent’s divorce, and this was likely the reason she was always so adamant on the friends sticking together.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_31>More recently, Ferrera has received a lot of attention for playing Amy on Superstore, and, looking ahead, she will be playing Elishia Kennedy in the new and upcoming television series WeCrashed.</p><h2 id=h-lena-kaligaris>Lena Kaligaris</h2><p id=par-12_37>Lena, also known as Lenny, was considered to be the shy or quiet friend of the group. Often focused or lost in her art, she sometimes found herself hesitant of others, especially when it came to love.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_47>Of course, as fans and followers of The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants already know, that all changed once Lena went to visit her grandparents in Greece. Bledel played the part of Lena, and, during that time, the star was already very popular due to <a href=#>Gilmore Girls</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-14_34>Though this era and chapter of life has long been closed for the cast, Lively and Reynolds’ wedding shows that the actresses, similarly to their fictional characters, seemed to have formed a lifelong bond.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvra3KnmSloaaaubq%2FjK2pmq6Vobavs4ypmKeso2KwsHnSrZirq12Wua150qGmsJ2UYsKxedaaq5ygXZ2ys3nMmqmrsV2nxqK6jKucsqafobG0esetpKVn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./11-superstars-from-prince-to-bob-marley-who-died-without-a-will.html><span>←</span><span>11 Superstars - From Prince To Bob Marley - Who Died Without A Will</span></a>

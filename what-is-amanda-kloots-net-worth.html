It was during her time in Bullets Over Broadway where she met her late husband, actor Nick Cordero.</p><p id=par-3_46>In addition to being an actor, Kloots is also known for a different passion: exercise. She’s been a well-known fitness instructor for years, and her personal brand outside of The Talk revolves around health and wellness. Kloots even offers workout subscription plans on her <a href=#>website</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/thetalk-cbs-sharonosbourne.jpg><h2 id=h-amanda-kloots-husband-died-of-covid-19>Amanda Kloots’ husband died of COVID-19</h2><p id=par-4_37>Kloots became more widely recognized in the public eye in 2020 when her husband became sick with COVID-19. He eventually died of complications from the disease, and Kloots publicly chronicled the whole saga on social media.</p><p id=par-5_63>“God has another angel in heaven now,” she said of Cordero in an <a href=#>Instagram</a> post. “Nick was such a bright light. He was everyone’s friend, loved to listen, help, and especially talk. He was an incredible actor and musician. He loved his family and loved being a father and husband. [Son] Elvis and I will miss him in everything we do, every day.”</p><h2 id=h-amanda-kloots-net-worth-in-2021>Amanda Kloots’ net worth in 2021</h2><p id=par-6_27>Kloots has put in hard work to get where she is today and has overcome immense personal obstacles in the past year specifically to get there.</p><p id=par-7_43>Her hard work is reflected in her net worth: according to <a href=#>GossipGist</a>, Kloots is worth approximately $1 million. Her salary on The Talk isn’t publicly known, but <a href=#>OK! magazine</a> has confirmed all the co-hosts make significantly less than Osbourne’s $1 million-per-season salary.</p><p id=par-8_18>Kloots’ first book, a memoir co-written with her sister Live Your Life, was released in June 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Amanda-Kloots-workout-1.jpg><h2 id=h-amanda-kloots-joined-the-talk-in-2021>Amanda Kloots joined ‘The Talk’ in 2021</h2><p id=par-9_42>2020 was an incredibly difficult year for Kloots. But like a phoenix rising from the ashes, Kloots has been able to bounce back from her personal tragedy — first with her personal fitness brand and later joining a nationally-broadcasted talk show.</p><p id=par-10_59>After rapper Eve left The Talk at the end of 2020, Kloots and Welteroth were brought on to sit alongside Osbourne, Sheryl Underwood, and Carrie Ann Inaba at the start of the show’s eleventh season in January 2021. Kloots has been an even-keeled presence on the show, as evidenced by her compassionate composure during Osbourne’s <a href=#>infamous on-air rant</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMrZilo12WuqK6w5pkpKSfpMG0ec2eq2avn6fBqXrHraSlZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-most-valuable-nba-teams.html><span>←</span><span>The Most Valuable NBA Teams</span></a>

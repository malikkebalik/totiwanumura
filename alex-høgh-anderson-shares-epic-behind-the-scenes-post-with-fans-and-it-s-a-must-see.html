Ivar is the last of Ragnar’s sons to see him alive, and he brings back the news of his father’s murder to his brothers and the people of Kattegat.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-2_26>Alex Høgh Andersen, who plays Ivar in <a href=#>Vikings</a>, recently shared some impressive behind-the-scenes photos and videos from season 6B that fans will surely want to see.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>[Spoiler alert: This article contains spoilers from ‘Vikings’]</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Alex-H%C3%B8gh-Andersen-in-Vikings-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ivar has a lot of pent-up rage</h2><p id=par-3_102>Ivar grows into an angry adult from his treatment in childhood. He felt his father didn’t want him, and he goes through life searching for greatness. When given the chance, he travels with his father back to Wessex. However, when Ragnar is murdered, all Ivar can think about is getting revenge, but he comes home to Kattegat with his mother, Queen Aslaug (Alyssa Sutherland), dead and Kattegat usurped by Ragnar’s first wife, Lagertha (Katheryn Winnick). This just makes Ivar angrier. Although he and his brothers get revenge on the kings of England for Ragnar’s death, it doesn’t lessen his anger and aggression.</p><p id=par-4_54>Eventually Ivar takes Kattegat back from Lagertha, calling himself a god and making the people in the town worship him. But even this doesn’t seem to quench his thirst for more power and prestige. But when Bjorn Ironside takes back Kattegat from Ivar, he leaves along the Silk Road to save his own life.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ivar fights with the Rus Vikings</h2><p id=par-5_41>He eventually becomes allies with Prince Oleg (Danila Kozlovsky), who is more ruthless than even Ivar. This is a critical time for him, since he realizes the brutality Oleg displays, and the two are quite similar in a variety of ways.</p><p id=par-6_68>Ivar is with Oleg (along with Hvitserk who reunites with his brother) when he tries to invade Scandinavia and take Kattegat. But the second wave of fighting leads to the Rus retreating when Bjorn, who is badly wounded, shows up on the battlefield still alive and riding out on his horse. When he’s shot by three arrows, he still survives, scaring the Rus who think he’s already dead.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_56>Ivar returns with Oleg and Prince Igor (Oran Glynn O’Donovan), whom he has grown very fond of. He helps Prince Dir (Lenn Kudrjawizki) and Igor overthrow Oleg, who is killed by Igor at Ivar’s insistence. After that, Ivar returns with Hvitserk to Kattegat, where he convinces King Harald Finehair (Peter Franzén) to go back to England.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ivar returns to England where he dies</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_83>Ivar battles King Alfred (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo), but the King of Wessex doesn’t take an offer for peace, and instead fights on. During the final battle, Ivar gets his brother to leave the thick of the fighting after soldiers recognize Hvitserk as a son of Ragnar and try to kill him. Ivar does nothing to prevent a Wessex soldier from stabbing him repeatedly after telling him “Don’t be afraid.” He hurts his legs during the battle, and he falls and dies in Hvitserk’s arms.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Alex Høgh Anderson shares an epic behind-the-scenes post from season 6B with fans</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-9_60>The final episodes of the series premiered on Amazon Prime Video last month, and the fates of everyone were decided. Some actors from the series have shared tributes and behind-the-scenes images recently, and fans seem to appreciate it. Alex Høgh Anderson, who plays Ivar, recently shared some epic images from the final two episodes, and they’re certainly worth looking at.</p><p id=par-10_69>There are quite a few interesting images in the post. Alex shared an epic still photo of the final battle scene with Marco Ilsø as Hvitserk during the fighting with Wessex. A burst of fire can be seen taking up a large majority of the image. There’s a behind-the-scenes photo of the first battle with Wessex in the trees as well. The crew gather around on the forest floor.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_46>Fans can also see a close-up shot of the Wessex soldiers in line for battle with their distinct red uniforms while a thick cloud of fog surrounds them in the background. There are also a few more photos of the battle in the woods as well.</p><p id=par-12_47>Alex even included a video showing himself as Ivar falling and hurting his leg during the fighting. Another video of Ivar in the final battle is also on display with Alex smiling at the camera with makeup on his face before he screams in Ivar’s native language.</p><p id=par-13_50>The last image is arguably the best one, since it includes Alex and Marco side by side smiling from ear to ear. Behind them is some fog, but the cast and crew can still be seen behind them. Alex has his arm around his co-star in the sweet behind-the-scenes moment.</p><p id=par-14_36>Alex captioned the post on&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>: “Here’s a few photos and videos I snapped on set while shooting the last 2 episodes of #Vikings&nbsp;⚔️ If you haven’t watched them yet look out for minor spoilers. Enjoy! Xx.”</p><p id=par-15_18>It’s always nice to see behind-the-scenes content of our favorite shows, and the actors for&nbsp;Vikings&nbsp;haven’t disappointed us yet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTDqrfIp56sZaOarrS7zWZtm2WRobK5eceonqFlkaOxpr7SqKVmq5iWv6a%2FjJ6noptdl7Kptc2dZK2glWLApLHNnqpmqJ%2BowW7DyK2fZp6Ro8Burc2dZKKso2KubrnUrKtmq5Wae6nAzKVm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jimmy-stewart-s-cause-of-death-and-his-last-words.html><span>←</span><span>Jimmy Stewarts Cause of Death and His Last Words</span></a>

He graduated with his M.D. in 1984. Pinsky is what’s known as an internist, or internal medicine physician. He is also known as an addiction specialist.</p><p id=par-3_50>Pinsky made his way into entertainment with&nbsp;Loveline, a love and sex call-in radio program, with comedian Adam Corolla. After earning notoriety, it made its way to TV format on MTV, airing from 1996-2000. The show featured co-hosts like actor Carmen Electra to make it more appealing to a young audience.</p><h2><strong>He continued in reality TV with ‘Celebrity Rehab’ and ‘Teen Mom’</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_51>After&nbsp;Loveline, Pinsky continued with radio programming. But he also became a fixture in reality TV during its burgeoning era in the ’00s. He hosted&nbsp;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&nbsp;and its spinoffs&nbsp;Celebrity Rehab Presents Sober House&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sex Rehab with Dr. Drew. Similarly, he leads the reunion shows of&nbsp;16 and Pregnant,&nbsp;Teen Mom, and&nbsp;Teen Mom 2.</p><p id=par-5_55>While these are the series he’s best known for, Pinsky has made a career as an actor on popular shows outside of reality TV. He was in an episode of&nbsp;<a href=#>Dawson’s Creek</a>&nbsp;and provided voices for&nbsp;Family Guy&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Simpsons. Pinsky had a role in the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen film&nbsp;New York Minute.

Generally, he speaks about the dangers of drugs and alcohol when there’s a death via overdose. However, he also weighed in on the most significant health crisis of 2020: the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p><p id=par-7_59>In early 2020,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pinsky made a series of statements</a>&nbsp;in which he called the virus “less dangerous than influenza” and said the “probability of dying of coronavirus — much higher being hit by an asteroid.” He later apologized for these comments, saying, “I wish I got it right, but I got it wrong.” In December 2020, Pinsky tested positive for COVID-19.</p><h2><strong>Dr. Drew net worth</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/drew-pinsky-2020.jpg><p id=par-8_51>In addition to acting and hosting, Pinsky has made numerous deals over the years to act as the face of medical procedures and products, such as lap band surgery.

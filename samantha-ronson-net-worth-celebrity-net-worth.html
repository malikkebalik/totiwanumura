They divorced when Samantha was 6 years old, and Ronson moved to New York City with her mother, siblings, and Ann's boyfriend, Foreigner guitarist <a href=# title="Mick Jones (Foreigner) Net Worth">Mick Jones</a>.

Samantha attended Manhattan's Chapin School, then she enrolled at New York University, where she studied philosophy and creative writing.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Ronson has said of her start as a DJ, "I got a call one night from a club that I used to hang out at and they were like, 'Do you want to DJ?' I was like, 'No way,' [but] my friends were like, 'Come on, just do it.' I was always in the club; [I figured I] might as well make money off it." She began to make a name for herself and eventually started DJing full-time. Samantha has DJed at events such as the Superbowl, the Sundance Film Festival, MTV's New Year's Eve show, the American Music Awards, and the Pan American Games. She was named Hennessy's official DJ&nbsp;in 2011, and she designed sneakers for Supra in 2009, 2010, and 2014.

Lindsay didn't comment on the rumors, preferring to "keep her private life private," and in a 2010 interview with "The Times," Ronson stated that she still loved Lohan as a person but that the attention from the paparazzi was hard to deal with. She initially stated that she dated both men and women, referring to herself as "an equal-opportunity player," but during a 2022 appearance on the "Queery" podcast, she said that after years of struggling to accept her sexuality, she identifies as gay.</p><p>In 2017, Samantha began a relationship with Cassandra Grey, the widow of producer <a href=#>Brad Grey</a>. Cassandra is the founder of the beauty company Violet Grey, which she sold to Farfetch in 2022.</p><p>In May 2007, a "small amount" of cocaine was found in Lohan's car after a crash, and blogger <a href=# title="Perez Hilton Net Worth">Perez Hilton</a> claimed that the drugs were Ronson's and began selling t-shirts that said "Blame Samantha" as well as calling her a "lezbot dj." Ronson sued Hilton for defamation, but her lawyer, Martin Garbus, eventually withdrew from the case. A judge ruled in Perez's favor and ordered Samantha to pay his legal fees. A few weeks later, Garbus sued Ronson for more than $140,000 in services and fees, but he later dropped the lawsuit. Samantha then filed a lawsuit against him, alleging that she lost the case to Hilton as a result of Garbus' incompetence. She asked for over $300,000 in damages, and Garbus countersued her.</p><p>In August 2011, Ronson was stopped by police in Las Vegas for driving nearly 90 mph in a 70 mph speed zone. After performing a balance test, Samantha was arrested on two misdemeanor charges of driving under the influence.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 2016, Samantha sold her 1,170 square foot home in Santa Monica, California, for $1.299 million. She paid $810,000 for the two-bedroom, two-bathroom home in 2012. In early 2023, Ronson and Grey listed their New York City home for $12 million. The 2,910 square foot condo features three bedrooms, three bathrooms, a powder room, and a chef's kitchen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97z6umna2Tmr%2B0e9KapJqmpJ2ubr7Op6qopl2jsrV51qipraBf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-money-does-peter-safran-make-latest-income-salary.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Money Does Peter Safran Make?

Though he is no stranger to appearing in sequels to his famous films, the success of Paramount Plus’s Tulsa King has opened the door for more.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=531 data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true>Produced by Paramount’s Yellowstone cash cow, Taylor Sheridan, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tulsa King follows a former enforcer</a> fresh out of prison and exiled to Oklahoma, where he starts his own criminal syndicate. The series has flourished under the leadership of Terence Winter, who is most known for creating the HBO period crime series, Boardwalk Empire. Recently Stallone has also had small appearances in the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy. All of this confluence of events has made fans wonder if there is a return to an old character in the works.</p><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=215 data-injectable=false>Stallone’s early role as <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Rambo</a></strong> remains a fan favorite and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has garnered 5 films</a>. A recent trailer called Rambo: New Blood teases that a sequel starring Jon Bernthal is slated to appear in 2024. But is it real?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-rambo-new-blood-getting-released data-injectable=false>Is Rambo: New Blood getting released?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/rambo-ii.png><p data-characters=476 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=true>The internet is been abuzz with conversation following the trailer of a supposed Rambo 6 trailer. With explosions and a gravelly narration, it could be easy to mistake it for the real thing. Unfortunately for fans, Rambo: New Blood is a fan-made trailer with shots edited together from The Expendables, among other projects. That sadly means that there is likely no future team-up of Stallone and Bernthal — no matter how well-suited the latter would be to such an endeavor.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>Stallone has also been upfront about any future appearances in the franchise. The 2019 film, aptly named Last Blood, seems to be the final entry for the action star. Seeing Stallone at his age, fighting and blowing things up probably wouldn’t hit as hard as it did in the ‘70s.</p><p data-characters=698 data-current-count=979 data-injectable=false>However, that isn’t to say that future Rambo projects are dead in the water. With an industry obsessed with making new what was once old, there is always potential. And in this case, there has been speculation around a television series. In 2015, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired</a> reported that Stallone was working on a potential series entitled New Blood. It is unclear if that version is going forward, but Stallone told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a> in 2022 that there may still be a prequel series in the works. That isn’t to say that we can expect anything to come out of this endeavor in 2024, but perhaps somewhere down the line, there could be a chance for Bernthal to join the franchise as fans have been clamoring for.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooKxlpJ2ys7GMmmSrmZ2XvG66xLBkm6SfpLFuvsSlnJqrlWKxosDEaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gravity-falls-creator-shares-absurd-disney-censorship-requests.html><span>←</span><span>Gravity Falls creator shares absurd Disney censorship requests</span></a>

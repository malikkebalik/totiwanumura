Well, add another name to your list.

Last week, Michelle Dobyne became the latest news cameo turned celebrity after recounting the events of a fire in her Tulsa, Oklahoma apartment complex earlier this month.
Like those before her, Dobyne had a few great catch phrases: &nbsp;&#34;"><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Maybe viewers would respond by offering assistance, but most likely they would chuckle and get on with their lives.</p><p class=story-text data-index=12>After Dobyne's&nbsp;interview hit the internet and got millions of views (currently more than five million) she became a You Tube sensation complete with an Auto Tune remix&nbsp;sold on iTunes (proceeds go to her) and offers to appear on television. Most everyone thought she was hilarious, but let's not forget, Dobyne and her family (she has three children) were living in their car -- there was a fire after all.</p><p class=story-text data-index=13>Which makes the age of the news&nbsp;interview gone viral both a complex mix of good and bad. On the one hand, internet stardom can be lucrative. On the other hand, how&nbsp;funny is it to laugh at (with?) members of the working class who've been displaced from their homes because of a tragedy?</p><p class=story-text data-index=14>If Dobyne, Dodson and Brown had not been so "funny" would anyone have cared or paid them any mind at all? And more important, what happens when their 15-minutes of fame runs out?</p><p class=story-text data-index=15>Dodson, of Huntsville, Alabama, became enough of a celebrity after trying to stop the attempted rape of his sister in 2010 to have his life chronicled by TMZ. The gossip site has reported over the last five years that Dodson&nbsp;denounced his homosexuality and last year had a son. His acting credits include&nbsp;Tyler Perry's <i>A Madea Christmas</i> and his last reported&nbsp;appearance was getting knocked out during a celebrity boxing match.</p><p class=story-text data-index=16>Another Oklahoman, Kimberly "Sweet Brown" Wilkins (who apparently gave a fake&nbsp;name for her live television interview) sued Apple for $15 million when a song on based on her recounting of an apartment fire appeared on iTunes as a hit song. She went on to do voiceovers and appeared on The View and Jimmy Kimmel Live. She introduced a line of BBQ sauce and sold t-shirts with her famous sayings, but lately her social media accounts have gone silent with no updates in over a&nbsp;year.</p><p class=story-text data-index=19><a href=#><strong>Dobyne has a GoFundme page</strong> </a>, which has raised more than the $20,000 goal in seven days. Donations are still coming in from people telling her how entertaining she is, applauding her "positive spirit" or simply offering words of kindness for her family.</p><p class=story-text data-index=20>But not everyone is happy with way things are shaking out. <a href=#><strong>Tulsa news station Fox23 reports that a neighbor</strong> </a>, the only one whose apartment was damaged in the fire, is upset that Dobyne is getting so much assistance even though her apartment was not destroyed. The neighbor stayed at a Red Cross Shelter while Dobyne stayed at&nbsp;motel.</p><p class=story-text data-index=21>Stardom, internet or otherwise, has its perks.</p><p class=story-text data-index=22>Dobyne now has a Twitter account and a booking agent. Her second tweet was to Atlanta-based radio host Rickey Smiley:</p><p class=story-text data-index=23>On Sunday, a reporter from the television station that first interviewed Dobyne tweeted that the power at Casa Linda Apartments was back on.</p><p class=story-text data-index=25>Dobyne and her dozens of neighbors could move back in to the apartment complex, the reporter said.</p><p class=story-text data-index=26>Dobyne retweeted the&nbsp;tweet. It wasn't clear if she would be returning or not.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orbCZ5qopV%2BXubCzjq2YpaNdqby4uo6moJyglaG5pnnDqJmyppViuaLAxKyrZq6Zp66tedWim56nXau2pMDOq2SvoZOptq57wpyZq62mbrOshLhpm6WRo3mWjb3HgmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./house-of-the-dragon-fans-can-t-believe-this-game-of-thrones-character-is-to-blame-for.html><span>←</span><span>House of the Dragon fans cant believe this Game of Thrones character is to blame for</span></a>

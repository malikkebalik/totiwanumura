<a href=../../j-k-rowling-shows-her-sympathetic-side-for-once-after-harry-potter-gets-arrested-for-crack-possessi.html></a>
“Sympathetic” isn’t a word you’d associate with J.K. Rowling very often, at least in the time period since the Harry Potter creator decided to repeatedly generate backlash and controversy with her stance on the transgender community.
Recommended Videos It’s almost impressive the way the author has managed to dismantle her reputation in the eyes of a fandom who used to hold her on the loftiest of pedestals for being the architect behind a literary saga – and ultimately an entertainment juggernaut – that so many people hold so close to their hearts.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Paul McCartney Changed the Lyrics of So Bad Because He Felt Bad for His Son</h2><time>Jul 26, 2024</time>

Paul McCartney was just one face of The Beatles — arguably the most popular band to ever exist. And while all four of them rose to fame together, many of the songs that took the world by storm were written by individual band members. Even after the band broke up, solo careers persisted, with John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr becoming quite successful in their own right.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Shia LaBeouf and Mia Goth expecting their first child</h2><time>Jul 26, 2024</time>

(Thinkstock)You may think you know your own mind, but when it comes to memory, research suggests that you don't. If we’re trying to learn something, many of us study in ways that prevent the memories sticking. Fortunately, the same research also reveals how we can supercharge our learning.
We’ve all had to face a tough exam at least once in our lives. Whether it’s a school paper, university final or even a test at work, there’s one piece of advice we’re almost always given: make a study plan.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Carlitos Way (1993): 100 Best Movies of the Past 10 Decades</h2><time>Jul 25, 2024</time>

There are a million stories about criminals sprung from jail who vow to go straight. And then there’s Brian De Palma’s Carlito’s Way. Al Pacino—swaggering, streetwise, lovesick—gives one of his strongest, most fine-grained performances as convicted drug felon Carlito Brigante, whose crooked lawyer (played, fabulously, by Sean Penn in a perfect approximation of a ’70s man perm) somehow gets him freed after just five years of a 30-year sentence. Carlito’s post-prison dream is to buy into a car-rental joint in the Bahamas—all the better if he can persuade the love of his life, Gail (Penelope Ann Miller), to join him, though he broke her heart before going up the river.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Fans blast the movies that are nothing but creatively bankrupt corporate shills</h2><time>Jul 25, 2024</time>

At the end of the day, the movie business is about making money. However, it’s a lot easier to bring in the desired profits if the film in question happens to be entertaining enough to not just draw in an opening weekend audience, but keep bringing them in for weeks on end, something Top Gun: Maverick has managed in spectacular fashion this year.

If you ever want a temperature check on how Bachelor in Paradise Season 9 is going, you can count on Olivia Lewis to keep you up-to-date — with some of her signature chaotic commentary, of course.

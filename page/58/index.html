Back in my day, tracking down fan merch was a task that had to be done in person. Whether I was finagling my way through a crowd of 7-year-olds getting their ears pierced at Claire‚Äôs or giving myself a pep talk before walking into a dark, intimidating Hot Topic, my favorite bands and artists‚Äô T-shirts were only available at brick-and-mortar stores or concerts.

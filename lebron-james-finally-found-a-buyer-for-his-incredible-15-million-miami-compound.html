Not only has he led the team to this year's&nbsp;NBA finals,&nbsp;but he really sealed his commitment to the Forest City when he decided to sell his compound in the Coconut Grove section of Miami, Florida. An update from Zillow&nbsp;has it that the property, last listed for $15 million, is&nbsp;under contract.</p><p>At nearly a half acre, the gated property consists of a 12,178-square-foot main house and a guest house. It's a modern, three-level compound, with six bedrooms, eight and a half bathrooms, and enough amenities to keep occupants disinterested in the outside world for days.&nbsp;Let's start with the exterior, where a three-car garage and parking court offers loads of space to welcome visitors. But this place has more than just car parking;&nbsp;try&nbsp;docking space for two 60' yachts.</p><p></p><p>Once you're in, it's hard to leave unless you got word of a not-to-be missed party going on somewhere. The&nbsp;heavy dark wood is offset by gleaming white floors and walls. All of the rooms on the main floor have two features in common: views of the endless Atlantic, and sophisticated paneling and woodwork in the ceilings.&nbsp;Athletes are always in search of delectable fuels, right? The&nbsp;vast kitchen, sorry culinary suite, is outfitted with a wall of cabinetry, modern appliances, and two islands: one for washing&nbsp;and prepping, and another for final presentation and eating. There is also a formal dining room and wet bar nearby.</p><p>A dedicated home office combines&nbsp;modern functionality with traditional looks, and there is also an eight-seat home theater for ultimate viewing.&nbsp;The bedrooms are pure luxury, including a couple in the back of the house that feature&nbsp;spa-like bathrooms and balcony access overlooking the ocean, and the master suite has a walk-in closet with an island dresser.</p><p>The&nbsp;infinity pool faces&nbsp;the ocean, for goodness sake. So residents or guests can actually stop to soak and let their troubles&nbsp;drift away. Where they go, nobody cares. It also has a waterfall feature, and in a festive touch, can be programmed to display a multicolored light show at night.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm60zqacrGeSqsaqusZmo56aoqS7tHmQbmSmoZyhtrC6jKagmqWZYrCwuc%2BorKecXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-did-50-cent-get-his-name.html><span>←</span><span>How Did 50 Cent Get His Name?</span></a>

She was sent home on Night 1 of <a href=# class=T3D>Zach Shallcross’ Bachelor season,</a> but was barely seen before that.</p><p>The Season 27 contestant took to Instagram to address her lack of screen time, writing that she was “nervous” that she might disappoint people by leaving so soon. “But I’m so proud of myself for putting myself out there no matter if a vanilla ice cream cone didn’t give me a rose,” she continued, seemingly referring to Zach.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Craig Sjodin/Disney General Entertainment Content/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Olivia got more exposure during Zach’s Women Tell All, where she defended controversial contestant <a href=# class=T3D>Christina Mandrell’s</a> “bold personality.” She also shaded <a href=# class=T3D>Kat Izzo,</a> who reminded Olivia she went home on Night 1.</p><p>“I did go home on Night 1,” Olivia replied. “And Zach got to learn your personality, and then sent you home. So what does that say about you?”</p><h2>She’s A Ref (Literally & Figuratively)</h2><p>Today, Olivia, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>who’s from Rochester, New York</a>, works as a patient care technician and a basketball referee. The latter requires her to keep a close eye on the gameplay and make controversial calls when needed. So it’s unsurprising that she’s taken on a similar role in Mexico, right?</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p>Bachelor in Paradise viewers have split opinions on Olivia’s commentary, but several praise her personality-filled confessionals.</p><p>One user on X (formerly Twitter) <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>said</a> she was “so messy” and “loves the drama,” making for funny segments. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Another</a> said they were “giggling this whole time” watching Olivia narrate the BiP happenings.</p><h2>She’s Been To More Than 1 “Paradise”</h2><p>Olivia’s playful personality makes her a natural fit for the chaotic nature of Paradise — but there’s another reason why she might feel so at home on the beach: She’s a traveler!</p><p>According to her Bachelor bio, Olivia has visited nearly every U.S. state and “comes from a family of jet-skiing enthusiasts.” Her Instagram <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>shows</a> she recently visited Greece with fellow Bachelor alum <a href=# class=T3D>Anastasia Keramidas,</a> too.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZqikmau2onnBmpqhnZykv261zWanmqqRmba0sYyjpptlmaPAta3Gq5imZZKevG6%2BxJqaraGfo8A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jensen-ackles-says-jared-padalecki-eats-way-more-than-him-while-filming.html><span>←</span><span>Jensen Ackles Says Jared Padalecki Eats Way More Than Him While Filming</span></a>

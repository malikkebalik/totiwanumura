Following her breakthrough role as <a href=#>Rocky Blue</a> on the Disney Channel show Shake It Up in 2010, she’s gone from TV actor to movie star. Her performances in films like <a href=#>Malcolm & Marie</a>, as well as her breakout role as <a href=#>MJ in the Spider-Man movies</a>, have established her as a major force in Hollywood. It should be no surprise then that Zendaya earned a $300,000 salary for her mere seven minutes of screen time in <a href=#>Dune: Part One</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-zendaya-plays-chani-in-dune>Zendaya plays Chani in ‘Dune’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-2_63>Directed by <a href=#>Denis Villeneuve</a>, Dune: Part One focuses on Paul Atreides, played by <a href=#>Timothée Chalamet</a>. Paul is the son of Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). In the film, Zendaya plays Chani, Paul’s love interest.&nbsp;In Frank Herbert’s book, Chani Kynes is a vital part of the story. The daughter of Liet-Kynes, she eventually helps Paul rule the galaxy.</p><p id=par-3_50>Zendaya was touted as one of Dune’s leading stars, along with Chalamet, Isaac, and Ferguson. She was featured extensively in the movie’s posters, trailers, and premiere events. However, in Dune: Part One, Zendaya doesn’t show up all that much. Chani mainly appears in Paul’s dreams and visions of the future.</p><p id=par-4_40>The first part of Villeneuve’s movie is about half of Frank Herbert’s classic science-fiction novel from 1965. Even though Zendaya’s character doesn’t do much in Dune: Part One, she is expected to be the main character in <a href=#>Dune: Part Two</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-zendaya-made-a-300k-salary-for-7-minutes-of-dune>Zendaya made a $300K salary for 7 minutes of ‘Dune’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_51>Before the October 2021 release of Dune: Part One, Zendaya confessed that her role in the film was relatively minor. In an interview with <a href=#>Empire</a>, she said,&nbsp; “My part is very, very small in this movie. That’s why I’m so excited to see it, to see what everyone’s been up to.”</p><p id=par-6_27>The star continued, noting her short amount of time on set. “I was only there for four days, and I did not want to leave,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_44><a href=#>Show Biz Galore</a> estimated Zendaya’s Dune salary to be $300,000. It’s quite a lot considering her minor role in the picture. Even though the amount is not as much as the rumored $2.2 million Chalamet earned, it’s not bad for four days of work.</p><p id=par-8_49>While Chalamet earned the most among the cast of Dune: Part One, Dave Bautista and Jason Momoa each earned $2 million for their respective portrayals of Glossu Rabban and Duncan Idaho. Oscar Isaac reportedly made $400,000 for his portrayal of Duke Leto Atreides, while Rebecca Ferguson allegedly made $500,000.</p><p id=par-9_22>Zendaya is expected to make even more money from the Dune franchise after the release of Dune: Part Two in November 2023.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-zendaya-s-net-worth>What is Zendaya’s net worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/zendaya-dune-salary.jpg><p id=par-10_33>Since her days on the Disney Channel, Zendaya has risen to prominence as an actor and producer. She went from being a child actor to a real movie star and a successful businesswoman.</p><p id=par-11_35>Zendaya first gained attention as a dancer and model before becoming a tween sensation on Shake It Up. However, it was her performance as MJ in <a href=#>Spider-Man: Homecoming</a> that truly propelled the actor to prominence.</p><p id=par-12_47>Given her rising star, <a href=#>Zendaya continues to earn more</a> and more per project. According to <a href=#>Wealthy Gorilla</a>, the actress made $140,000 for Shake It Up, $300,000 for her role in Spider-Man Homecoming, $300,000 for Spider-Man: Far From Home, and about $2 million for <a href=#>Spider-Man: No Way Home</a>.</p><p id=par-13_18>It’s no surprise that <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a> estimates Zendaya’s wealth at $20 million, considering all her successful projects.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTHprrDmrCaZZ2WsaZ5kmlnpGWjlrmivthmbmalmaPCtbHSZpuuppVjtbW5y2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./winky-wright-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Winky Wright Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
